# My Work Experience
I have a LOT of different work experience and it is difficult for other to understand what it is that I have done and how it fits into some chronological order. The truth is
the experiences don't really have a logical order because most of my work is project based and I typically work on more than one project at a time. I also take unpaid work as 
seriously as I do paid work, so the project that were unpaid could have more in depth documetation than a paid position given the time spent working on the project and the skills acquired
from that experience.

In this document I will attemmpt to explain all of my technical work experience and the interpersonal and technical skills I learned during each experience. I hope that this document
is useful for others who are interested in understanding what I have done and how it plays into my larger skillset.
