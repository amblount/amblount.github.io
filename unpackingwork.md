# My Work Experience
I have a LOT of different work experience and it is difficult for other to understand what it is that I have done and how it fits into some chronological order. The truth is
the experiences don't really have a logical order because most of my work is project based and I typically work on more than one project at a time. I also take unpaid work as 
seriously as I do paid work, so the project that were unpaid could have more in depth documetation than a paid position given the time spent working on the project and the skills acquired
from that experience.

In this document I will attemmpt to explain all of my technical work experience and the interpersonal and technical skills I learned during each experience. I hope that this document
is useful for others who are interested in understanding what I have done and how it plays into my larger skillset.

### Relevant (Current) Projects w/ Technology Used

- Predicting Diamond Prices - imported a labeled dataset (csv) of diamond data into alteryx and analyzed features in the dataset to predict the price of a new dataset of diamonds using linear regression.
- Predicting Catalog Demand - used a prompt from the manager to determine whether it would be profitable to send 200 catalogs to new customers based on prior sales data. Imported a dataset of customer data into alteryx and determined which features were significant based on the calculated p-value of each predictor. Created a scatterplot to view whether there was a linear correlation between the significant feature predictor variable. Created a multivariate linear regression equation using the features I determined to be significant and applied new feature data from the dataset in question to determine the predicted amount of profit for each customer. I then aggregated the profit from all the customers to determine whether or not it would be profitable to send out the catalogs to this customer dataset based on the prompt, which questioned whether the profit exceeded $10,000. 
- Create An Analytical Dataset - Aggregated 6 datasets containing information about chains of a convenience store in Wyoming in alteryx. This data was used in creating a regression model.
- Predicting Risk Default - Created a model to help a bank determine which customers were at risk of default using logistic regression in alteryx.
- A/B Test - As an analyst for a coffee restaurant the executive team conducts a market test with a new menu and needs to figure whether the new menu can drive enough sales to offset the cost of marketing the new menu. In this project I analyzed the A/B test and recommended that the chain launch the new menu.
- Forecast Video Game Sales - As a supply chain analyst that sells video games the manager has requested the analysts forecast monthly sales data in order to help plan out the supply with demand for the companies video games. Used time series forecasting and applied ETS and ARIMA models to the time-series to predict future months sales.

### WORK EXPERIENCE
- Engineering Fellow | Blue Ridge Labs (Robhinhood Foundation) |	Brooklyn, NY 	|		2021

  - What team or product did I work on?


As a member of the fellowship program I worked with multiple teams to explore different aspects of poverty. We spent the first few months of the program thinking interviewing people living in poverty who were affialiated with Blue Ridge to hear their experiences and take notes. This part of the fellowship centered around user research. We used tool called Mural to create stakeholder maps and cluster themes from the user interviews into topics of interest that we could potentially build solutions for. 
    
The second phase of the program consisted of working groups which were about 3-4 people and lead by one of the fellowship members. Every fellow had an opportunity to lead a week long sprint where they would inform their team members about the topic at hand and scout members of the community which they intended to serve so that the team could interview and understand some of the problems impacting that community. 

    I worked on three teams:
    1. Support Groups for trans people of color
    2. Resource Support for Returning Citizens
    3. Comprehension (Literacy) App for early readers [Leader of this Sprint]
    
    I also worked solo on one project:
    1. Food Access [Understanding Mutual Aid Networks and Food Pantries]
   
The sprints were 1 week long and at the end of each week the team was responsible for creating a prototype for an app that would serve that community, informed by the user research from the week.
   
The last few months of the sprint were spent working on one project with one team on one of the projects from the weeks prior. We went through a voting process to select the projects that we felt would have the most impact and were able to self select into teams from that point. I worked on RC-Connect a product that would help returning citizens understand what programs and resources currently exist to help them re-integrate back into society. We thought a lot about the social support aspect of the re-integration process. 

  - What was the impact of this project or team in relation to the company?

The Robinhood Foundation donates millions of dollars in grants every year to nonprofit organizations who are doing work to help improve the lives of people living in poverty. I was drawn to the fellowship because of this mission statement and I learned a lot about certain organizations that have used grants from the Robinhood Foundation to improve systems in New York City. I think the most impressive example I came across was that of City Harvest. City Harvest works with restaurants and grocery stores in and around New York City to transport food that would be wasted to local food pantries for free. They operate ~55 trucks that run around the city each day transporting food. They have an entire supply chain and mapping delivery system that allows drivers to optimize their time and create schedules that keep promixate locations in sequence to ensure the drivers have enough time to pick up and drop off all of the food each day. This operation would not be possible without the financial support from Robinhood. Many of the wealthiest people in the city donate large amounts of money to organizations like Robinhood and place them in charge of distributing those funds each year.

  - What did I work on?

In the past I worked on a project which I called comprehension. Comprehenion was a reading system that I designed which would help parents of elementary school students by pulling out themes in books and helping parents explain those themes to their children. I spent a lot of time understanding the reading system that places certain books at a certain age range and I created a database of books which a student at every grade level from K-5 should be able to read and understand on their own. 

I created a video where I walked through what a typical read aloud moment could be like in a video which you can watch below:
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nEPcT-4bOJQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

During the sprint that I led in the fellowship I wanted to learn about literary science and so I interviewed a few people in academis about phonics and phonemes and how exactly a student goes about learning how to read on grade level. 

There were many terms and concepts that I was unaware of before I started this research study. [This article](https://www.reading.com/blog/the-key-to-literacy-phonemic-awareness-and-phonics/) does a decent job of explaining some of those topics:

      - Phonological awareness
      - Phonemic awareness
      - Names and sounds of letters

  - Who did I work with?

I am trained as a engineer and I applied to the program as an engineering fellow. My purpose in the fellowship and on my teams was to advise the other non-engineers of what would be possible to build and how we could potentially build a product given what our goals and user experiences were. We also had product and design fellows who specialized in user experience design and product marketing management. The last aspect of the program involved a type of fellow known as a domain expert. The domain experts had some sort of lived experience that was related to the topic of interest and had deep connections with other people in the community who they were able to reach out to to get more information about the topic or resources that we could use to build the product.

  - What assumptions did I make coming in?

I didn't assume user interviews would be as complicated as they turned out to be. In the first part of the program I had to re-learn interviewing skills. I learned about how to pay attention to body language and by re-listening to some interviews with the designers on my team I was able to understand how to pull out subtle messaging from what the interviewee said. Those are skills I didn't think I would use at all.

  - What technology or tools did I use?

      - Mural - design tool for stakeholder mapping, and theme clustering
      - Otter.AI - interview transcription tool. We used this a lot to record interviews and re-read what was said
      - Zapier + Integromat (Automation tools)

  - What hurdles did this team face?

We had a lot of trouble selecting groups. When we had to narrow the projects down to just three many people had hurt feelings about their ideas not being selected. Once we got into groups we had to make other difficult decisions about the actual product we intended to build and we did not always agree on an approach. We had some trouble with distributing the workload, if we had to get through two stakeholder maps and two interviews it was difficult to decide who were the appropriate parties to work on what.

  - What was the outcome of the project?

There is a follow up program called Catalyst, that all program fellowship teams have the opportunity to apply for. My team applied but was not selected so we decided to work on other projects separaretly.

  - What external courses or educational resources did I use to skill up?

There was a large google drive full of resources that the Robinhood Foundation provides to all fellows. That was basically a source of truth along with the Mural maps that we created.

- Product Manager | UMG Innovation Challenge | 	Los Angeles, CA |		2021
  - What team or product did I work on?

This project was a part of an innovation challenge. We were grouped into teams generically and we met these people for the first time online.

  - What was the impact of this project or team in relation to the company?

Most artists earn a significant portion of their income touring and performing. Due to the COVID-19 lockdown many artists were struggling to keep engagement with their fans and Universal Music Group reached out to developers and innovators in their network to try and get ideas around how they could continue to engage. 

  - What did I work on?
 
 [Duets](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b04Ks4Zh3iNWSKIOvIUhQdohTxtaPkFd/view) - the first social content creator platform built to capture human movement and music.

  - Who did I work with?

I worked with another product manager a software engineer and two developer advocates who worked on music products in the past.

  - What assumptiosn did I make coming in?

I didn't think I would hear from industry professionals at Abbey Road or other higher level execs who would have opinions on the state of social media platforms like tik tok and others. I didn't realize how much of an impact social media was having on the business of music. Everything changed during and after COVID-19.

  - What technology or tools did I use?

We prototyped and the software engineer on the team used javascript to help create the demo. We also use AR-kit a bit.

  - What hurdles did this team face?

We didn't have much time together given everyone had fulltime jobs outside of the project and this was only a two week sprint.

  - What was the outcome of the project?

We were introduced to many execs at Abbey Road, they really enjoyed watching our project demo.

  - What external courses or educational resources did I use to skill up?

In this case I didn't use any but in the future I would encourage anyone else interested in this type of work to read the [Abbey Road Round-Up](https://www.abbeyroad.com/news/abbey-road-reds-monthly-round-up-march-2022-edition-3125), it's a monthly newsletter containing information about the state of music technology.

- Robotics Fellow | Circuit Launch 	|	Oakland, CA 	|		2020


  - What team or product did I work on?

Circuit Launch is a playground for roboticists. Many people come into the space to work on building their robotics start-ups and they host a fellowship where you can get hands on building a robot from scratch.

  - What was the impact of this project or team in relation to the company?

There was no company this was just a learning experience for me. I had so may questions about how the hardware and software play together in the field of robotics and I was only familiar with computer simulations. I didn't have any idea about how to build and robot and get it working.

  - Who did I work with?

In the lab there were roboticists who earned PhDs in robotics from UC Berkeley and other start up founders.

  - What assumptiosn did I make coming in?

I didn't know much about hardware at all. I didn't know what to expect.

  - What technology or tools did I use?

I paid attention to the hardware espects so I purposefully didn't work much on the software.

  - What hurdles did this team face?

Getting all the aspects to work together the hardware and the software can be difficult.

  - What was the outcome of the project?

We built Reachy the robot arm that could pick up a marker and write on the board.

  - What external courses or educational resources did I use to skill up?


There are courses on Coursera that teach introduction to robotics, those are in depth courses because they require you ro read through University two-term text books which describe complex topics in robotics.

- Director of Innovation | Bloc | 		Brooklyn, NY 	|		

  - What team or product did I work on?

This was a promotion with the team to the executive suite where I worked specifically on grant writing and feature creation.

  - What was the impact of this project or team in relation to the company?

Spent a lot of time re-searching and writing a grant proposal for the Microsoft Innovation Grant and managing two summer programs with CUNY students.

  - What did I work on?

Our work builds off the prototypes these platforms have currently deployed and optimizes for the user experience of the neurodiverse learner. We are using the 1619 project as the course curriculum and the Pulitzer generated engagement opportunities as the active learning segments for the curriculum and creating a user experience for neurodiverse students combining the material on our learning platform. It will demonstrate how to take a curriculum and break it down on the concept level, and provide multimedia data inputs for conceptual learning to help students understand the impact and significance of the work. We are incorporating this learning into data journalism projects that students will build adding skills to their portfolio and helping the student qualify for employment opportunities.

Online learning platforms have only designed a knowledge base for math going up to introductory calculus concepts, chemistry, and business. This leaves all of the other domains relatively untouched. In person after school centers in America have created diagnostic assessment tests that help place students into the learning journey and provide active engagement opportunities for students by requiring that students complete physical packets everyday for a specified period of time. The personalization process and ongoing diagnostic component comes into place when students go into the center and work through one of their assignments with an instructor. The instructor can view in real time what portions of the material the students understands and does not understand and can make recommendations about if the student should move forward in the curriculum or if the students needs to repeat a lesson to gain concept mastery.

We are building a data warehouse full of text, images and video specific to the 1619 project including all of the writing from the project - https://pulitzercenter.org/sites/default/files/full_issue_of_the_1619_project.pdf and the Pulitzer generated exercises for student engagement - https://pulitzercenter.org/builder/lesson/activities-extend-student-engagement-26505 . We are matching the learning to the exercises in a web based platform with multimedia content. We intend to use these two resources to create a concept map of all of the concepts described in the project and sequence the material into an American History learning pedagogy that can be used to help students actively engage with historical events. We will test and record students' conceptual understanding through data journalism projects that build off of new skills practiced during the concept understanding process. We plan to use Azure knowledge mining to help us parse through all of our data sources and enable filtering at the concept level. This demo-https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/videos/knowledge-mining-ai-driven-content-understanding-with-cognitive-search-on-azure/ inspired this project.

We have a curriculum with content for user experience design and a data science. Both programs aim to expose students to design and data science at a high enough level where they have a portfolio and enough information to continue building. Our students lack exposure to either of these fields and our platform aims to create a personalized learning journey that presents the curriculum in bite sized pieces and challenges the students' understanding after every milestone. We are not creating new content per-se we have taken resources that are currently available for free on the web, but we have put a lot of work into creating concept maps and feedback loops that help us understand concepts the student has mastered and concepts that still need more work.

After a student has explored a curriculum chunk they are asked to respond to questions about the chunk to test their understanding. The text input from the student is compared to a master index of responses that indicate the students level of understanding of the material. We use azure cognitive services to parse the text input and create an understanding index for that user. With the understanding index we are able to select the next resource to send to the user and re-test their understanding. This leads to each student having a personalized learning experience and enables students to move through the resources at their own pace.

  - Who did I work with?

I worked withh the COO to design the project.

  - What assumptiosn did I make coming in?

I assumed that it would be much simpler to gain buy in from other members of the team and that they would understand the direction I was trying to go with the technology. It was much more difficult than I expected to gain buy in from other member of the team because they didn't seem to udnerstand the technology.

  - What technology or tools did I use?

This was a grant proposal and if implemented we would use Azure Machine Learning Cloud Solution Tools.

  - What hurdles did this team face?

Getting buy in was difficult and getting time with other sectors of the company to explain the usefullness of the project was a big challenge.

  - What was the outcome of the project?

We did not receive this grant but we were awarded two other grants.

  - What external courses or educational resources did I use to skill up?

Grant writing is a trial and error sort of deal. I think that taking a course on scientific writing could be useful in understanding grant writing. You need to focus on writing for non-technical readers and that can be challenging.

- Product Engineer | Bloc |			Brooklyn, NY 	|		2019


  - What team or product did I work on?

Core Sales Team with Bloc.

  - What was the impact of this project or team in relation to the company?

We had a few paying customers and the job of the product engineer was to speak with the customer and identify bugs in the working product to fix them right away.

  - What did I work on?

Fixinf engineering and fixing bugs in the code. A bit of design. I did redesign the home page.

  - Who did I work with?

Lead software engineer and another product engineer.

  - What assumptiosn did I make coming in?

I figured customers would make more time to test a product they were paying for. It seems like if you are not building a product that solves an immediate need and the funds have already been allocated to the service, the end user might just forget about the product and continue using the solution they came up with beforehand.

  - What technology or tools did I use?

   - ruby on rails
   - javascript
   - material design

  - What hurdles did this team face?

Communication and technical debt were really big challenges with this team.

  - What was the outcome of the project?
I moved into a director role.

  - What external courses or educational resources did I use to skill up?
Exploring what stakeholders are and why they are important was a huge takeaway from this team.
