# My Work Experience
I have a LOT of different work experience and it is difficult for other to understand what it is that I have done and how it fits into some chronological order. The truth is
the experiences don't really have a logical order because most of my work is project based and I typically work on more than one project at a time. I also take unpaid work as 
seriously as I do paid work, so the project that were unpaid could have more in depth documetation than a paid position given the time spent working on the project and the skills acquired
from that experience.

In this document I will attemmpt to explain all of my technical work experience and the interpersonal and technical skills I learned during each experience. I hope that this document
is useful for others who are interested in understanding what I have done and how it plays into my larger skillset.

### Relevant (Current) Projects w/ Technology Used

- Predicting Diamond Prices - imported a labeled dataset (csv) of diamond data into alteryx and analyzed features in the dataset to predict the price of a new dataset of diamonds using linear regression.
- Predicting Catalog Demand - used a prompt from the manager to determine whether it would be profitable to send 200 catalogs to new customers based on prior sales data. Imported a dataset of customer data into alteryx and determined which features were significant based on the calculated p-value of each predictor. Created a scatterplot to view whether there was a linear correlation between the significant feature predictor variable. Created a multivariate linear regression equation using the features I determined to be significant and applied new feature data from the dataset in question to determine the predicted amount of profit for each customer. I then aggregated the profit from all the customers to determine whether or not it would be profitable to send out the catalogs to this customer dataset based on the prompt, which questioned whether the profit exceeded $10,000. 
- Create An Analytical Dataset - Aggregated 6 datasets containing information about chains of a convenience store in Wyoming in alteryx. This data was used in creating a regression model.
- Predicting Risk Default - Created a model to help a bank determine which customers were at risk of default using logistic regression in alteryx.
- A/B Test - As an analyst for a coffee restaurant the executive team conducts a market test with a new menu and needs to figure whether the new menu can drive enough sales to offset the cost of marketing the new menu. In this project I analyzed the A/B test and recommended that the chain launch the new menu.
- Forecast Video Game Sales - As a supply chain analyst that sells video games the manager has requested the analysts forecast monthly sales data in order to help plan out the supply with demand for the companies video games. Used time series forecasting and applied ETS and ARIMA models to the time-series to predict future months sales.

### WORK EXPERIENCE
- Engineering Fellow | Blue Ridge Labs (Robhinhood Foundation) |	Brooklyn, NY 	|		2021

  - What team or product did I work on?


As a member of the fellowship program I worked with multiple teams to explore different aspects of poverty. We spent the first few months of the program thinking interviewing people living in poverty who were affialiated with Blue Ridge to hear their experiences and take notes. This part of the fellowship centered around user research. We used tool called Mural to create stakeholder maps and cluster themes from the user interviews into topics of interest that we could potentially build solutions for. 
    
The second phase of the program consisted of working groups which were about 3-4 people and lead by one of the fellowship members. Every fellow had an opportunity to lead a week long sprint where they would inform their team members about the topic at hand and scout members of the community which they intended to serve so that the team could interview and understand some of the problems impacting that community. 

    I worked on three teams:
    1. Support Groups for trans people of color
    2. Resource Support for Returning Citizens
    3. Comprehension (Literacy) App for early readers [Leader of this Sprint]
   
The sprints were 1 week long and at the end of each week the team was responsible for creating a prototype for an app that would serve that community, informed by the user research from the week.
   
The last few months of the sprint were spent working on one project with one team on one of the projects from the weeks prior. We went through a voting process to select the projects that we felt would have the most impact and were able to self select into teams from that point. I worked on RC-Connect a product that would help returning citizens understand what programs and resources currently exist to help them re-integrate back into society. We thought a lot about the social support aspect of the re-integration process.
