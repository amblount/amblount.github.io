# My Work Experience
I have a LOT of different work experience and it is difficult for other to understand what it is that I have done and how it fits into some chronological order. The truth is
the experiences don't really have a logical order because most of my work is project based and I typically work on more than one project at a time. I also take unpaid work as 
seriously as I do paid work, so the project that were unpaid could have more in depth documetation than a paid position given the time spent working on the project and the skills acquired
from that experience.

In this document I will attemmpt to explain all of my technical work experience and the interpersonal and technical skills I learned during each experience. I hope that this document
is useful for others who are interested in understanding what I have done and how it plays into my larger skillset.

### Relevant (Current) Projects w/ Technology Used

- Predicting Diamond Prices - imported a labeled dataset (csv) of diamond data into alteryx and analyzed features in the dataset to predict the price of a new dataset of diamonds using linear regression.
- Predicting Catalog Demand - used a prompt from the manager to determine whether it would be profitable to send 200 catalogs to new customers based on prior sales data. Imported a dataset of customer data into alteryx and determined which features were significant based on the calculated p-value of each predictor. Created a scatterplot to view whether there was a linear correlation between the significant feature predictor variable. Created a multivariate linear regression equation using the features I determined to be significant and applied new feature data from the dataset in question to determine the predicted amount of profit for each customer. I then aggregated the profit from all the customers to determine whether or not it would be profitable to send out the catalogs to this customer dataset based on the prompt, which questioned whether the profit exceeded $10,000. 
- Create An Analytical Dataset - Aggregated 6 datasets containing information about chains of a convenience store in Wyoming in alteryx. This data was used in creating a regression model.
- Predicting Risk Default - Created a model to help a bank determine which customers were at risk of default using logistic regression in alteryx.
- A/B Test - As an analyst for a coffee restaurant the executive team conducts a market test with a new menu and needs to figure whether the new menu can drive enough sales to offset the cost of marketing the new menu. In this project I analyzed the A/B test and recommended that the chain launch the new menu.
- Forecast Video Game Sales - As a supply chain analyst that sells video games the manager has requested the analysts forecast monthly sales data in order to help plan out the supply with demand for the companies video games. Used time series forecasting and applied ETS and ARIMA models to the time-series to predict future months sales.

### WORK EXPERIENCE
- Engineering Fellow | Blue Ridge Labs (Robhinhood Foundation) |	Brooklyn, NY 	|		2021

  - What team or product did I work on?


As a member of the fellowship program I worked with multiple teams to explore different aspects of poverty. We spent the first few months of the program thinking interviewing people living in poverty who were affialiated with Blue Ridge to hear their experiences and take notes. This part of the fellowship centered around user research. We used tool called Mural to create stakeholder maps and cluster themes from the user interviews into topics of interest that we could potentially build solutions for. 
    
The second phase of the program consisted of working groups which were about 3-4 people and lead by one of the fellowship members. Every fellow had an opportunity to lead a week long sprint where they would inform their team members about the topic at hand and scout members of the community which they intended to serve so that the team could interview and understand some of the problems impacting that community. 

    I worked on three teams:
    1. Support Groups for trans people of color
    2. Resource Support for Returning Citizens
    3. Comprehension (Literacy) App for early readers [Leader of this Sprint]
    
    I also worked solo on one project:
    1. Food Access [Understanding Mutual Aid Networks and Food Pantries]
   
The sprints were 1 week long and at the end of each week the team was responsible for creating a prototype for an app that would serve that community, informed by the user research from the week.
   
The last few months of the sprint were spent working on one project with one team on one of the projects from the weeks prior. We went through a voting process to select the projects that we felt would have the most impact and were able to self select into teams from that point. I worked on RC-Connect a product that would help returning citizens understand what programs and resources currently exist to help them re-integrate back into society. We thought a lot about the social support aspect of the re-integration process. 

  - What was the impact of this project or team in relation to the company?

The Robinhood Foundation donates millions of dollars in grants every year to nonprofit organizations who are doing work to help improve the lives of people living in poverty. I was drawn to the fellowship because of this mission statement and I learned a lot about certain organizations that have used grants from the Robinhood Foundation to improve systems in New York City. I think the most impressive example I came across was that of City Harvest. City Harvest works with restaurants and grocery stores in and around New York City to transport food that would be wasted to local food pantries for free. They operate ~55 trucks that run around the city each day transporting food. They have an entire supply chain and mapping delivery system that allows drivers to optimize their time and create schedules that keep promixate locations in sequence to ensure the drivers have enough time to pick up and drop off all of the food each day. This operation would not be possible without the financial support from Robinhood. Many of the wealthiest people in the city donate large amounts of money to organizations like Robinhood and place them in charge of distributing those funds each year.

  - What did I work on?

In the past I worked on a project which I called comprehension. Comprehenion was a reading system that I designed which would help parents of elementary school students by pulling out themes in books and helping parents explain those themes to their children. I spent a lot of time understanding the reading system that places certain books at a certain age range and I created a database of books which a student at every grade level from K-5 should be able to read and understand on their own. 

I created a video where I walked through what a typical read aloud moment could be like in a video which you can watch below:
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nEPcT-4bOJQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

During the sprint that I led in the fellowship I wanted to learn about literary science and so I interviewed a few people in academis about phonics and phonemes and how exactly a student goes about learning how to read on grade level. 

There were many terms and concepts that I was unaware of before I started this research study. [This article](https://www.reading.com/blog/the-key-to-literacy-phonemic-awareness-and-phonics/) does a decent job of explaining some of those topics:

      - Phonological awareness
      - Phonemic awareness
      - Names and sounds of letters

  - Who did I work with?

I am trained as a engineer and I applied to the program as an engineering fellow. My purpose in the fellowship and on my teams was to advise the other non-engineers of what would be possible to build and how we could potentially build a product given what our goals and user experiences were. We also had product and design fellows who specialized in user experience design and product marketing management. The last aspect of the program involved a type of fellow known as a domain expert. The domain experts had some sort of lived experience that was related to the topic of interest and had deep connections with other people in the community who they were able to reach out to to get more information about the topic or resources that we could use to build the product.

  - What assumptions did I make coming in?

I didn't assume user interviews would be as complicated as they turned out to be. In the first part of the program I had to re-learn interviewing skills. I learned about how to pay attention to body language and by re-listening to some interviews with the designers on my team I was able to understand how to pull out subtle messaging from what the interviewee said. Those are skills I didn't think I would use at all.

  - What technology or tools did I use?

      - Mural - design tool for stakeholder mapping, and theme clustering
      - Otter.AI - interview transcription tool. We used this a lot to record interviews and re-read what was said
      - Zapier + Integromat (Automation tools)

  - What hurdles did this team face?

We had a lot of trouble selecting groups. When we had to narrow the projects down to just three many people had hurt feelings about their ideas not being selected. Once we got into groups we had to make other difficult decisions about the actual product we intended to build and we did not always agree on an approach. We had some trouble with distributing the workload, if we had to get through two stakeholder maps and two interviews it was difficult to decide who were the appropriate parties to work on what.

  - What was the outcome of the project?

There is a follow up program called Catalyst, that all program fellowship teams have the opportunity to apply for. My team applied but was not selected so we decided to work on other projects separaretly.

  - What external courses or educational resources did I use to skill up?

There was a large google drive full of resources that the Robinhood Foundation provides to all fellows. That was basically a source of truth along with the Mural maps that we created.

- Product Manager | UMG Innovation Challenge | 	Los Angeles, CA |		2021
  - What team or product did I work on?

This project was a part of an innovation challenge. We were grouped into teams generically and we met these people for the first time online.

  - What was the impact of this project or team in relation to the company?

Most artists earn a significant portion of their income touring and performing. Due to the COVID-19 lockdown many artists were struggling to keep engagement with their fans and Universal Music Group reached out to developers and innovators in their network to try and get ideas around how they could continue to engage. 

  - What did I work on?
 
 [Duets](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b04Ks4Zh3iNWSKIOvIUhQdohTxtaPkFd/view) - the first social content creator platform built to capture human movement and music.
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cs-zCNkC5fQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
 
  - Who did I work with?

I worked with another product manager a software engineer and two developer advocates who worked on music products in the past.

  - What assumptiosn did I make coming in?

I didn't think I would hear from industry professionals at Abbey Road or other higher level execs who would have opinions on the state of social media platforms like tik tok and others. I didn't realize how much of an impact social media was having on the business of music. Everything changed during and after COVID-19.

  - What technology or tools did I use?

We prototyped and the software engineer on the team used javascript to help create the demo. We also use AR-kit a bit.

  - What hurdles did this team face?

We didn't have much time together given everyone had fulltime jobs outside of the project and this was only a two week sprint.

  - What was the outcome of the project?

We were introduced to many execs at Abbey Road, they really enjoyed watching our project demo.

  - What external courses or educational resources did I use to skill up?

In this case I didn't use any but in the future I would encourage anyone else interested in this type of work to read the [Abbey Road Round-Up](https://www.abbeyroad.com/news/abbey-road-reds-monthly-round-up-march-2022-edition-3125), it's a monthly newsletter containing information about the state of music technology.

- Robotics Fellow | Circuit Launch 	|	Oakland, CA 	|		2020


  - What team or product did I work on?

Circuit Launch is a playground for roboticists. Many people come into the space to work on building their robotics start-ups and they host a fellowship where you can get hands on building a robot from scratch.

  - What was the impact of this project or team in relation to the company?

There was no company this was just a learning experience for me. I had so may questions about how the hardware and software play together in the field of robotics and I was only familiar with computer simulations. I didn't have any idea about how to build and robot and get it working.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RcxiJRNPyCE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  - What did I work on?

We built reachy the robot.
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sv1M-qa3Z24" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  - Who did I work with?

In the lab there were roboticists who earned PhDs in robotics from UC Berkeley and other start up founders.

  - What assumptiosn did I make coming in?

I didn't know much about hardware at all. I didn't know what to expect.

  - What technology or tools did I use?

I paid attention to the hardware espects so I purposefully didn't work much on the software.

  - What hurdles did this team face?

Getting all the aspects to work together the hardware and the software can be difficult.

  - What was the outcome of the project?

We built Reachy the robot arm that could pick up a marker and write on the board.

  - What external courses or educational resources did I use to skill up?


There are courses on Coursera that teach introduction to robotics, those are in depth courses because they require you ro read through University two-term text books which describe complex topics in robotics.

- Director of Innovation | Bloc | 		Brooklyn, NY 	|		

  - What team or product did I work on?

This was a promotion with the team to the executive suite where I worked specifically on grant writing and feature creation.

  - What was the impact of this project or team in relation to the company?

Spent a lot of time re-searching and writing a grant proposal for the Microsoft Innovation Grant and managing two summer programs with CUNY students.

  - What did I work on?

Our work builds off the prototypes these platforms have currently deployed and optimizes for the user experience of the neurodiverse learner. We are using the 1619 project as the course curriculum and the Pulitzer generated engagement opportunities as the active learning segments for the curriculum and creating a user experience for neurodiverse students combining the material on our learning platform. It will demonstrate how to take a curriculum and break it down on the concept level, and provide multimedia data inputs for conceptual learning to help students understand the impact and significance of the work. We are incorporating this learning into data journalism projects that students will build adding skills to their portfolio and helping the student qualify for employment opportunities.

Online learning platforms have only designed a knowledge base for math going up to introductory calculus concepts, chemistry, and business. This leaves all of the other domains relatively untouched. In person after school centers in America have created diagnostic assessment tests that help place students into the learning journey and provide active engagement opportunities for students by requiring that students complete physical packets everyday for a specified period of time. The personalization process and ongoing diagnostic component comes into place when students go into the center and work through one of their assignments with an instructor. The instructor can view in real time what portions of the material the students understands and does not understand and can make recommendations about if the student should move forward in the curriculum or if the students needs to repeat a lesson to gain concept mastery.

We are building a data warehouse full of text, images and video specific to the 1619 project including all of the writing from the project - https://pulitzercenter.org/sites/default/files/full_issue_of_the_1619_project.pdf and the Pulitzer generated exercises for student engagement - https://pulitzercenter.org/builder/lesson/activities-extend-student-engagement-26505 . We are matching the learning to the exercises in a web based platform with multimedia content. We intend to use these two resources to create a concept map of all of the concepts described in the project and sequence the material into an American History learning pedagogy that can be used to help students actively engage with historical events. We will test and record students' conceptual understanding through data journalism projects that build off of new skills practiced during the concept understanding process. We plan to use Azure knowledge mining to help us parse through all of our data sources and enable filtering at the concept level. This demo-https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/videos/knowledge-mining-ai-driven-content-understanding-with-cognitive-search-on-azure/ inspired this project.

We have a curriculum with content for user experience design and a data science. Both programs aim to expose students to design and data science at a high enough level where they have a portfolio and enough information to continue building. Our students lack exposure to either of these fields and our platform aims to create a personalized learning journey that presents the curriculum in bite sized pieces and challenges the students' understanding after every milestone. We are not creating new content per-se we have taken resources that are currently available for free on the web, but we have put a lot of work into creating concept maps and feedback loops that help us understand concepts the student has mastered and concepts that still need more work.

After a student has explored a curriculum chunk they are asked to respond to questions about the chunk to test their understanding. The text input from the student is compared to a master index of responses that indicate the students level of understanding of the material. We use azure cognitive services to parse the text input and create an understanding index for that user. With the understanding index we are able to select the next resource to send to the user and re-test their understanding. This leads to each student having a personalized learning experience and enables students to move through the resources at their own pace.

  - Who did I work with?

I worked withh the COO to design the project.

  - What assumptiosn did I make coming in?

I assumed that it would be much simpler to gain buy in from other members of the team and that they would understand the direction I was trying to go with the technology. It was much more difficult than I expected to gain buy in from other member of the team because they didn't seem to udnerstand the technology.

  - What technology or tools did I use?

This was a grant proposal and if implemented we would use Azure Machine Learning Cloud Solution Tools.

  - What hurdles did this team face?

Getting buy in was difficult and getting time with other sectors of the company to explain the usefullness of the project was a big challenge.

  - What was the outcome of the project?

We did not receive this grant but we were awarded two other grants.

  - What external courses or educational resources did I use to skill up?

Grant writing is a trial and error sort of deal. I think that taking a course on scientific writing could be useful in understanding grant writing. You need to focus on writing for non-technical readers and that can be challenging.

- Product Engineer | Bloc |			Brooklyn, NY 	|		2019


  - What team or product did I work on?

Core Sales Team with Bloc.

  - What was the impact of this project or team in relation to the company?

We had a few paying customers and the job of the product engineer was to speak with the customer and identify bugs in the working product to fix them right away.

  - What did I work on?

Fixinf engineering and fixing bugs in the code. A bit of design. I did redesign the home page.

  - Who did I work with?

Lead software engineer and another product engineer.

  - What assumptiosn did I make coming in?

I figured customers would make more time to test a product they were paying for. It seems like if you are not building a product that solves an immediate need and the funds have already been allocated to the service, the end user might just forget about the product and continue using the solution they came up with beforehand.

  - What technology or tools did I use?

   - ruby on rails
   - javascript
   - material design

  - What hurdles did this team face?

Communication and technical debt were really big challenges with this team.

  - What was the outcome of the project?
I moved into a director role.

  - What external courses or educational resources did I use to skill up?
Exploring what stakeholders are and why they are important was a huge takeaway from this team.

- Product Manager | Executive Virtual Assistant (E.V.A.) 	|		Berkeley, CA 	|		2019

  - What team or product did I work on?

A friend and I started to explore possible solutions for an application something like concur that would make it possible to itemize receipts for business executives, given this is the most tedious aspect of the job of an executive assistant.

  - What was the impact of this project or team in relation to the company?

This was our only product or feature and the purpose was to eliminate the need for concur and manual data entry.

  - What did I work on?

I worked on exploring the laws around digital (electronic) receipts in California and the feature development roadmap of the concur premium product.
We also explored the possibility of creating an application that would allow large parties to book dinner reservations online because that is not currently possible. When you book a large party you have to contact the host and figure out if there is space on the night that you want and you must call around a lot.

  - Who did I work with?

A friend who was at the time an executive assistant with Uber.

  - What assumptions did I make coming in?

I didn't know what an executive assistant was so I had to do a lot of listening to understand the job.

  - What technology or tools did I use?

We didn't build a real prototype it was simply an exploratory analysis.

  - What hurdles did this team face?
Exploring the concur API was challenging.

  - What was the outcome of the project?

Electronic receipts were stated to be mandatory in the next 5 years but there were too many places where execs typically travel that did not require them yet making the product execution not plausible at that time.

  - What external courses or educational resources did I use to skill up?

Product blogs and websites like techcrunch were useful.
We built out this product and its features using the Y-combinator start-up school.

- Program Manager (Commercial Sales and Marketing Group) CSEO | Microsoft 	|		Redmond, WA 	|		2019

  - What team or product did I work on?

I worked with the director of CSEO to understand customer success. This team was a sales team that worked on managing relationships with enterprise customers on existing product use. If a customer was say Starbucks and Starbucks is managing 10 accounts over 5 regions that all manage a number of physical starbucks retail stores and each store in consuming a numner of seats of the microsoft office product, this team ensures every seat that is being paid for in this account chain is actually being used. There are some enterprise customers with large accounts who have too mant unused seats or credits in cloud services like azure or other customers who do not have enough seats and have a bunch of service requewst tickets asking for more seats.

I spent a significant amount of time speaking with customer account managers to learn about the process of managing accounts and reading customer success stories to learn about how companies are currently using specifically the azure cloud services along with other Microsoft bundles to improve their business operations. Those stories are open to the public and you can read them here:

https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/home?sq=&ff=&p=0

  - What was the impact of this project or team in relation to the company?

Because Microsoft as a company has a large B2B product offering, ensuring that the companies who use Microsoft products and services know how the products work and are able to solve their business needs is critical to the business function. This is the purpose of the customer success department and role. 

  - What did I work on?

After joining the team I spent the first few months writing a document filled with recommendations on how to improve the customer success feedback channel from account examination to a meeting with the account manager. There was an entire team of senior program managers working on a product which would track a customer relation concern to the product team (ex: Microsoft Office) and put the customer in a funnel to understand the problem at hand and ensure the technical support representative was able to contact the individual and provide meaningful feedback.

  - Who did I work with?

Other program managers working in Azure, Office and the executive suite. I also spent some time chatting with the data engineering team about account management given duplication was a huge problem with no current solution.

  - What assumptiosn did I make coming in?

I didn't understand the purpose of such a large sales department in a company like Microsoft and the tier of customer who uses the product.

  - What technology or tools did I use?

- Power BI
- Internal Directory tool to find product owners working things pertinent to what I was working on and attend particular meetings

  - What hurdles did this team face?

Documentation and meeting notes. There were nt formal meeting notes for many of the prior meetings and to there was a lot of duplication of work. There was a team of designers working on the customer success ticket project but they were duplicating a design study that had been completed 2 years prior but could not find the documentation of the work given new deisngers had come on board and old designer left. I had to dig in that internal directory and find designer who moved into other organizations in the company to find the old design documents and bring them into the conversation about the current process.

  - What was the outcome of the project?

The ticketing system (customer success was launched). A new customer success director came on board and sort of overhauled the leadership team working on customer success so a lot of thigns changed.

  - What external courses or educational resources did I use to skill up?

This role was about a chain of command and communication. It was primarily concerned with attending meetings and understanding who was responsible for doing what. At my level I didn't really have any say so with regard to decision making but I did have a lot of information to pass from one stakeholder to another. I became really effective at communicating via email succinctly.

Exploring program management is important. It's very specific to the program that you are working on and understanding the needs of that program.

- Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) Fellow | Insight Data Science 	|	San Francisco, CA 	|	2018

  - What team or product did I work on?

This was a project based fellowship. I worked on understanding how reinforcement learning could improve emergency resident scheduling. This actually turned into a contraint optimization problem which is well known in the field of operations research.

  - What was the impact of this project or team in relation to the company?

This was my first attempt at a deep learning project and my first intorudction to reinforcement learning as a concept. One of my research interests is meta-learning which is based on the concepts from metalearning.

  - What did I work on?

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_sK_n_OHgHA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

#### Automating Scheduling for ED residents at UCSF

Data Journalism: I have been interested in [big data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gx9IGKLi2e4) for a while now because I am fascinated by telling stories with data. I spent this past summer at the New York Times understanding data journalism by listening to writers explain their writing process and the investigative journalism that goes into it. Data journalism goes beyond re-telling facts and seeks to explore the utility behind the information. Once you aggregate your data and understand the metadata affiliated with your data set, you can decide what sort of statistical analysis to run on the data. Artificial intelligence mixes up this process a bit and lets the neural network gain an understanding of your data and imply how probable an outcome is. The foundation here is still statistics and probability without some of the manual work.

Hello Insight: This winter I decided I would spend time diving into an AI project end-to-end and that is why I decided to participate in the [Insight Data Science](https://insightfellows.com/data-science) fellowship as an [AI fellow](https://insightfellows.com/ai). During the first week of the fellowship, I explored projects and settled on a prompt to use reinforcement learning for control systems. The prompt was as follows:

Currently, rules (control policy) for the mechanical operations (control loops) of most sophisticated machinery are set by human experts, which require tremendous time and domain expertise. If we can teach machines to learn these rules and reduce the reliance on scarce human experts, that has far-reaching impacts across all manufacturing fields.

The complexity and diversity of control loops in hard technologies like metal 3D printing make them a good candidate for Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL algorithms usually require a lot of trials and it is expensive and dangerous to run physical trials. But combining RL with simulation will not only optimize the control policy for more efficiency and time saving, it also can disrupt manufacturing by developing new methods that require less complicated machinery.
Use case:

Scheduling of emergency medicine doctors in inner-city hospitals

Deliverable:
Deep reinforcement learning as a service platform that can learn a policy using a specific simulation environment or existing dataset. The service needs to interfaces with the engineer to gather the model and objective function and potentially take advantage of imitation learning and off-policy learning to improve the speed of convergence and gather bounds on each parameter to help reduce search space. The service should take advantage of asynchronous and parallel deep RL techniques to speed up the learning process as well. The accuracy of policy should exceed human generated policy.

How did I think about the problem: I have a lot of experience in the hospital given earlier in my undergraduate studies I majored in chemistry and planned to attend medical school. In preparation for that, I volunteered in different departments at different hospitals to understand what life was like as a physician. One experience that I pulled from when thinking about this problem was my internship experience at the University of California, Davis Medical Center in the Pediatric Emergency Department. I worked an overnight shift two days per week, and there are a few things that stood out for me.

The department was understaffed
Emergency room nurses and physicians were overworked
The UCD medical center has a certain number of nurses and doctors who are contracted to work in that particular facility. When schedules are being created for a particular facility you are only able to use the medical providers who are contracted to work there. If there are 150 shifts to fill in one medical center for a week and only 70 medical providers then the medical providers might be scheduled every day, and essentially under-worked.

Why don’t medical facilities hire more workers?: This would make sense if supply met demand, but in this case, it does not. In the case of nurses and doctors, these medical practitioners are specialized. Not only do these providers need to attend medical school or nursing school they also need to choose a specialty. For my project, we are thinking about Emergency Medicine as that specialty. The emergency department specializes in keeping people alive when something has gone wrong. You might think about patients who are suffering from a stroke or someone who has a heart attack and needs immediate treatment. The pediatric emergency department is even more of a rare case because pediatric patients (children) have organs and bones which have not yet fully developed and are more sensitive to slight environmental changes. All in all it takes a while to train an emergency medicine practitioner and there just aren’t very many.

In the USA today there are 5273 emergency departments and 39,547 [Emergency Medicine providers](https://www.aamc.org/data-reports/workforce/interactive-data/active-physicians-sex-and-specialty-2015). There are about [139 million](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/emergency-department.htm) visits to the Emergency Department each year, which averages to around 380,821 visits each day. If all the physicians in the USA were working all day, then each of these physicians would be responsible for ~10 visits.

Problem: A reasonable Emergency Medicine (EM) shift lasts 8 hours but a typical shift lasts around 12 hours. There are work regulations limiting the space between shifts requiring there are at least 8 hours off between shifts. Given the scarcity of ED physicians and the amount of ED visits, there is more demand than supply and often the scheduling requirements are unmet and physicians are required to work more often than they should.

UCSF: For this particular project I worked with the University of California, San Francisco to understand the way their emergency department was organized and it turns out it is a very complicated system. I was specifically working on understanding the scheduling system for the medical residents who are not yet doctors. The residents have rotations throughout the year and only a segment of this schedule involves rotating through the ED. When a new round of residents is assigned placement within the UCSF program the program admins get a block of resident assignment detailing which residents will be available and which particular weeks they will be available. The schedule looks something like this:

![schedule](-ed-current-sched.png)

Resident availability for the year, broken down by week segmented by blocks
The rotation assignment in this spreadsheet are color coded and the pink and baby blue cells correspond to the time when the residents will be available to pick up shifts in the emergency department. This spreadsheet does not detail which particular shifts the residents will be working, there is an additional step which needs to be figured out to make that happen.

Preprocessing: The first step involved in making this data usable for any algorithm is cleaning the data. It is necessary to reformat this data in a way which clusters either the weeks and the residents available for that week or the residents and a list of all of the weeks they are available. This is an important step because we currently have data for every department in the hospital and when each resident will be in the emergency department, but we only care about when the residents will be available to work in the emergency department.

When looking at the data it is also clear that this csv is not going to be easy to work with given there are multiple data clusters on the same sheet and the columns and rows are not clearly organized. Even though all of the data is technically available we need to do a lot of manual work to get the data formatted in a way where we would be able to use it for the purposes of scheduling.

Future work: There needs to be some front-end framework or properly labeled CSV file where whoever is inputting the data can input this information into the csv in a way which would allow the clustering of the data to be usable by other teams. I spent quite a bit of time thinking through the proper database design techniques for this particular use case, but my design process did not only build for the initial preprocessing step it also included steps for creating relationships between residents, shifts, and facilities which we will get into a little later in the post.

Useful CSV format example:
With a list of residents, how can we think about modeling the entire system?

Shifts

Dimensions?

How many residents work each shift?
After assigning a letter to each shift, I then assigned another letter to each shift start and end time combination. Many of the facilities have the same start and end time combinations so we can assign the ‘shift’ to multiple facilities.

    Content management system for developers to gain pull resources from.

  - What did I work on?
    
Now that students are locked inside and forced to learn online, designing engaging online communities is more important than ever. In this article, I want to share what I learned helping to build a few online communities for international student developers using Facebook groups. I want to focus on the design of the group, specifically what information should be included, why this information is important, and how to ensure that all of the group members are able to engage with the material in a meaningful way. I am going to assume that you have done all of the leg work to get your students into a group of some sort and you can use this post to think through the different ways that students engage with the content available in the group.

Passive Learners

In online groups, some students choose not to create content like posts or messages but instead prefer to read the content which is already there. They spend a significant amount of time clicking on links provided, watching videos and reading other students' responses to the content providing reactions to the content via, likes or reshares. For passive learners, it is important to ensure there is a learning path available. They need to understand the content sequentially and be able to visually map out where they are going in terms of learning objectives and what they mean. In learning groups, it is typically not enough to have only the content by the instructor in the group, you need other learners or leaders to provide text explanations of why the content is useful or important for the passive learner to engage with. Open-ended content assignments might be the most useful for learners of this style given the requirement that they respond to a prompt of some sort. It could also be useful to post content for all students and assign paired assignments where students answer a few questions and then the assignment involves the student sharing their partners' responses.

Active Learners

If there is content already posted in the group, these learners are going to engage with the content by posting their thoughts about the content publically and responding to their peers' posts. Active learners demonstrate one way to engage with content, but it is important that their contributions to the learning environment to not overshadow the other students. If participation points are given to students or groups just based on the number of posts comments or shares, you will find that some groups are trending well according to the data only because an active online learner is boosting the analytics in the group. While the engagement of one over-enthusiastic student is not negative it is also not reflective of the engagement of the group as a whole or even the learning happening in the community.

Discussion

While the content creators in each group (instructors) are familiar with the ideas being presented, the students in the group are being presented with new ideas they are encountering for the first time. Traditional Socratic methods of instruction in public schools do an awful job of providing personalized learning solutions which I attribute to the poor learning outcomes, but online learning groups also leave a lot of students cut and dry given their inability to creating meaningful interactions between all members of the group. For students to learn new information it is important for them to have meaningful interactions with their peers about the content because it is one of the only ways for students to contextualize the information. In online learning groups, facilitators can encourage meaningful dialog between group members by creating prompts that all students are required to respond to by a specific time. Students should also be required to respond to other students' posts, and providing an opinion or follow up question to the post.

Time

If the learning group is able to build some sort of community, as time goes on the interactions between the group members should improve. The quality of posts should improve and different learning styles might start to mesh. Active learners whose ideas have been challenged more frequently might become more passive and comment more than they post or react more than they post. Passive learners might start to share resources that they have been engaging with elsewhere and others in the group find meaningful.

Study Strategies

While the online group might contain all of the ideas which students are tasked with exploring and contextualizing it is critical that students are equipped with good study skills to complement that material. Without an independent strategy to sit with the material and contextualize it, students will not be able to effectively engage with other group members because they lack a general understanding of the material and what it sought out to teach. The stagnant content on the platforms serves as a skeleton that students can refer back to but as the class progresses it is important that students can identify aspects of the curriculum which are important and form opinions about that content. Pre-lecture and post-lecture posts are one way to moderate this engagement in an online setting.

For example, in a group devoted to careers in data the first post can ask students why they decided to join the group?

Welcome to the summer 2020 virtual inernship on careers in data. What motivated you to join this group and what career paths are you familiar with in this sector? Post a link to a job in the data field and comment on a post describing a job you haven't heard of.
This post is general enough that without any background each student should be able to reply to the post and go through an exercise on searching and exploring content outside of the group to relay that information back to the group. After a lesson exploring some of the careers in the field, students should be able to answer certain questions about the content presented. It is easy for a content moderator to place all of the learning in a one-off assignment but that would not be a good example of content moderation and would halt a lot of student engagement in the online group. Posting the learning objective questions as a series of posts in the unit encouraging students to comment on the post would enable students to think about what they learned and chat about it with other students. A group leader could start by tagging a particular student in the group and asking a targeted question about the content starting a series on responses and have each student tag another student for a response.

Before and after each learning session, students should come in with questions that the instructor should be aware of and hopefully get those questions answered during the online time together. After a learning session, students should walk away with new questions with they should have the skills to research on their own. In my own experience as an online learner, it is really important for me to use my notepad effectively. Writing down topics that I am unfamiliar with and writing down questions that I need to get more clarification on are important skills that have helped me level up and should be encouraged for online learning.


Office Hours

Zoom calls or google hangouts are going to be the main source of office hours, but students need to be encouraged to use them because most do not understand what they are or how they can be useful. Short video clips welcoming students to the office hour and giving them examples of topics that could be discussed during the office hour are useful posts to create around the time of the discussion, maybe an hour or two before the session starts. Reminding students to create a calendar invite for the event and possibly add their questions to it would be a useful task as well.

The developer circle program was divided into regions:

North America
EMEA
LATAM
India
South East Asia
We had five program managers who would manage the developer circles in each region. This included tracking and helping to plan offline events. Traveling to different cities to support the events in person and constructing weekly, bi-weekly, and monthly reports on current events in region and circle. On a very high level after briefly speaking with the program managers it was clear that each program manager had a different way of handling events in each region, but there was no aggregate data on offline events. It seems the events would happen but there was no attendance data or way to measure the success or failure of an event. In an attempt to understand the problem more in-depth I created a survey that has a series of questions related to offline events. I wanted to understand the entire process from when there was an idea for an event to during and after the event took place. The survey consisted of questions like:

How many events happen in your region each month?
How do you track this?
How do you communicate with your developer circle leads to help them plan an event?
What tools do you use during this process? (messenger, email, google docs)
How do you or the lead advertise for the event?
What social media tools have been successful in your region?
How do you measure the success of an event?
How are you currently collecting attendance data for your events?
How do you know how many events happened in your region?
After reviewing the responses from this survey, I spoke with each program manager individually for a 1-hour conversation about how we could create more efficient processes to handle event management. I took thorough notes from these conversations and wrote reports on my findings after each step of the process and shared these notes with the global management team. After reviewing all of the responses to the phone conversations it was clear that the current event creation technology tool we proposed the developer circle leads use, was very hard to use, and the developer circle leads needed training on how to use the tools. It was also very clear that because the current program managers were not technical they were struggling with finding content for the offline events. The developer circle leads were in charge of creating content for these events, but frequently they had no idea where to start in creating material for the events. The developers were looking for training to help them get better jobs or their first development jobs and they needed reference material for the tutorial they wished to present on.

What is it like to be a developer in the developing world?

The infrastructure problems of the program were clear to me at this point, but I was not sure what it was like to be a developer in a developing country and I had a hypothesis that the needs of a developer in a developing country were not the same as the needs of a developer in America. I would frequently read over posts and comments in the most and least active (in terms of online active engagement) groups and noticed the quality of the posts was pretty poor. I started to think about how developers in a developing community could have meaningful events with low quality online content. I hypothesizes that if the content in the online group were of high quality then the developers in the group would spend a lot more time consuming that content and the engagement in the groups would go up. I also assumed that there was a lack of context on the part of the developers in the group on how to use the online group to get their needs met.


The Field Research Study

One of the program managers in EMEA mentioned there was a great female lead in Tunis, Tunisia who lead a very engaged circle and that if we had the capacity we should support one of her events. I saw this as an opportunity to test my assumptions and created a plan on how I would do this. A few months earlier I attended the field study masterclass by Jan Chipchase and used his textbook the Field Study Handbook to conduct the study.

Here is what I did:

Made a warm introduction to the developer circle lead, mentioning that it would be awesome to support her upcoming event.
Asked her what type of content would be presented during the event and how I could help support her.
Based on her content, I created a pre-event content guide filled with online resources explaining the topic more in depth and how to apply technical frameworks to solve the problem.
I also planned to host a pre-event workshop detailing what data science looks like on my team at Facebook and what resources I used to get into data science online.
Asked for recommendations of group member who I could reach out to to understand the development ecosystem in the area more in depth and interview these members.
Created a survey for the selected developers to describe their interest in the developer circle community and specifically what the community could use to become a more active and engaged community.
Discussed the survey results with my team of program managers to get some initial feedback.
Spoke with the EMEA region program manager about particulars on traveling to the region

The refined user research design process

I did not always have such an in depth research process and I think that it is important to note the way that I became such an in depth product researcher.

Back in 2016, I started my web development boot-camp experience. I didn't have much coding experience and so in a lot of the group projects I worked on initially, I was the front-end web designer. I spent a lot of time building front-end web apps using Google's Material design and a Firebase backend. The documentation for both of these frameworks is really easy to get started with so I got to know a lot about making a website look pretty. The more and more I built web applications the more I started to think about the amount of time that I was spending rebuilding for the user experience. At the time I was unfamiliar with what a user-experience designer actually was, but I did know that if I spent more time initially speaking with the end users of my product I would be able to build a better product. This sent me down an entire rabbit hole and caused me to change the way that I would build projects.

Before integrating user experience design + research:

Building a product looked something like this:

Ideate with other software engineers about what it is we would like to build
Search through documentation online to understand what data we have available which we could use for the project
Create a few general wireframes, which would pictorially represent a login page, a sign-up page and one page which displayed the core functionality of the app
After integrating user experience design + research:

Building product looks more like this:

Find a question out in the world which has yet to be answered in a way suitable for me or someone else
Explore ways in which other people have tried to solve the problem before
If someone has successfully designed something useful before, think through how I could improve that product, and what would make my solution better and explicitly how.
If I can not find anyone who has built a similar solution, explore why others did not find the space worthy enough to build in and weigh the costs and benefits to spending time and resources building in said space
3. Chat with as many product owners or end users as possible to understand how and why they would this product

Get these people to draw pictures of solutions they imagine
Ask them for recommendations to other similar products with some component which they find outstanding, and figure out why
4. Build a prototype of the product

5. Determine if any team (in a large org) is willing to allocate financial resources to the project, validating its build

6. Explore the engineering resources available for maintenance of the product

If there is only one engineer available to build a product and the team is trying to scale a Weebly, or WIX solution would be more valuable
If there are 2-10 engineers allocated to the project and there are more than 100,000 anticipated end users, you can think more about scale and speed for architectural design solutions
7. Create a technology stack design implementation over sprints

Based on the answers to the questions above you can determine things like:
cloud versus local storage, and how much
database schema design
API integrations
User account management
security and data privacy
analytics integration
8. Create a project plan

As you create a project roadmap, you understand in the amount of time you have dedicated to a particular project how much can you reasonably get done
Figure out what are the most important features to implement right away to get a minimum viable product
Figure out how to place additional features into production accordingly in sprints
Match the resources to a budget, if you have a roadmap with 12 months of development work required but only enough money for 3 months of development time, you need to explore which features from the development roadmap are the most important and place all of them in the first sprint and make sure that the developers are only working on building those particular features, nothing more and definitely nothing less
9. Start building!

Identify the problem and build the solution

After the trip, I learned that developers in the developing countries are trying to bridge the gap between traditional education (university) and skills which would make them ready for work. They have a broad range of interests but do not currently have the skills to contribute to the workforce at the moment. I realize then that we needed a product which would help these students and graduates bridge this gap. In development, we already had a partnership with Kaplan to provide web development training in an online format, but the team had not fully examined what would be the most useful curriculum to distribute. As a person who graduated from dev bootcamp, the physical bootcamp which distributed the Kaplan content, I was able to give a lot of insight into how and why this curriculum would be relevant or not. I also had a broad range of knowledge about what other topics students in the field cared about.

I created a project plan which detailed the topic areas which I determined students cared about and would need practical skills to move forward. I then prioritized the three tracks which we could build the curriculum for by sourcing the web and writing guides for.

Check out one of the groups:

You can browse around the site. The guides that you see, I write the text for, the links were sourced by me, and the learning path was developed by me, the sequence of steps.

I managed a team of engineers which we hired as external vendors, there were 5 engineers, one user experience designer, and a database administrator. We had daily 30 minute stand up sessions where we discussed the progress of the project. They had an external JIRA board which I monitored and we created a project road map dividing the project into sprints over 12 months. The first sprint ended with the launch of the product at F8, and we decided to postpone the production of the product until we understand how the users were using the product so that we would understand where exactly we should invest more money.

This project had a budget of $1.5 million dollars to serve a community of around ~150,000 developers. This product was intended to serve as an introductory tool to help developers go from University graduates with no practical work experience to entry-level developers with a few projects under their belts. There are many online resources for learning how to code, but some have a very high price tag per/ head so we did not have the budget to finance each person and other programs did not contain the practical personalized learning experience which has been proven to promote understanding and help the new learning process and digest new information. This was an important differentiating factor when thinking about how we would structure the program because we did not want to provide students with surface-level "Simon Says" projects because the learners would not be able to transfer the understanding to an employer and the value would be lost. We wanted to make sure to include multiple perspectives from a variety of content creators so that consumers with different learning styles would be able to consume the ideas being presented. This was really important in making sure that the funds we did have for this project were being managed well and would provide utility to our community.

At a high level, here is what I did.

+ Wrote Python script to move metadata from Google Sheets to BigQuery to explore use cases for new GCP product datahub.
+ Developed orchestration workflow to schedule Python DAG script execution using Airflow, and automated authentication process.

  - What team or product did I work on?

I worked with the Data Governance Team, which is a smaller team of product leads who own the meta-data related to major projects within the organization. The Data Governance team creates the standards for data quality stores in BigQuery (the online cloud database) to ensure that the data is being properly labeled and that no stale data is being maintained (someone has to be in charge of deleting or re-naming things). A good high level overview of the purpose of this team would be the equivalent of an internal diectory of employees. When you start working with a large company you might want to understand the organizational chart. This is the document or sructure within the company that informs everyone who the stakeholders are or who reports to whom and is in charge of what. You can take a look at the [people](https://www.nytco.com/company/people/) section of the company to get an idea of who does what.

Read more about the data governance initiatives at the Times, [here](https://open.nytimes.com/how-the-new-york-times-thinks-about-your-privacy-bc07d2171531)

The New York Times is a major news publication in New York City, (Manhattan) and is notorious for producing extremely high quality journalistic pieces of writing. From the company [website](https://www.nytco.com/company/)

> The New York Times is dedicated to helping people understand the world through on-the-ground, expert and deeply reported independent journalism.

I worked with the engineering sector of the company that is charge of the web and mobile electronic versions of the publication. Many old school long time subscribers get the Sunday paper delivered in physical form to their doorstep but because of modern times and the prevalence of smart phones most people are subscribing online and reading the paper on an e-reader like a kindle or i-pad. Because of this change the NYT has become a technology company that needs to support features and use cases for online readers.

> Since 1851, The New York Times has been on the ground reporting stories from around the globe that no one else was telling. How we tell those stories has changed, but our mission to seek the truth and help people understand the world has remained constant.

This company has been producing papers for a long time and a whole lot of articles have been written about a ton of topics. This translates to a lot of data. Each article has a name and a topic that users need to be able to filter through. If you think about all of the current sections of the newspaper that are worth reading:

- fashion
- modern living
- art
- music
- film
- cooking

To name a few, every article has a lot of meta-data involved with it and there is a need for that information to be sorted and easily queryable. This is why the data enginering team is important and what they are actually responsible for maintaining.

  - What was the impact of this project or team in relation to the company?

**Data migration**
The old school physical paper is virtually out the window but as is the physical data warehouse. During 2018 the company decided to shut down the physical data warehouse that stores all of the legacy data from forever. So they had a few floors in a building they were renting each month where they housed a lof of computers. Those computers stored all of the information that company has collected from forever! That s a lof of data, and they decided to move it ALL to the cloud. They decided to migrate from local data servers which were owned and managed by the Times to rented storage space from Google Cloud Services.

I was just an intern during this time so I wasn't in charge of a huge project. There was an entire data engineering team! They were working on most of the heavy lifting I was in charge of helping one of the senior program managers on the data governance team migrate the meta-data she held dear in a google sheer to affiliated tables of data already living in the cloud using BigQuery. 

[The Goods Paper](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/45390.pdf): 
The goods paper shared insight into a new product that was emerging within Google Cloud.

#### [Google Catalog](https://cloud.google.com/data-catalog/docs/concepts/overview)
The Goods paper eventually turned into Google catalog the product now available on GCP. At this time in development the product was in Beta and the NYT was a beta testing customer. We had 3 google product specialists on site to help answer technical questions from the data engineering team and two product managers, one working specifically on Data Catalog to help us test implementation.

  - Who did I work with?

I spent a lot of time thinking about Data Science and Research and I thought it was incredible that you could actually have a career in data as a researcher. I didn't think about what I wanted to do as a career but I did think about the fact that I wanted to think about thinking and problem solving a lot. I spoke with so many senior team members around the office about what it was like to be a professor or a researcher as a career and what it looks like to earn a PhD. 

#### The Journalists
If you read my [blog post about podcasting](https://amblount.github.io/podcasting) back in 2015, you know that I was introduced to Kara Swisher for the first time in person in San Francisco. Well, she announced that she was joining the times as an [opinion writer](https://www.nytco.com/press/kara-swisher-to-contribute-to-opinion/) and I lost my SHIT! She has come a long way because now she has a [column](https://www.nytimes.com/column/kara-swisher), it makes sense. Anyway back in the day when I was a superfan and heard she was coming I organized a conversation between Kara and Michael Barbaro, which was a FUCKING BIG DEAL! 

> They are journalism superheros. Put some **RESPECT** on my name

  - What assumptiosn did I make coming in?


  - What technology or tools did I use?

    - SQL
    - BigQuery
    - Google Sheets API

  - What hurdles did this team face?
  - What was the outcome of the project?
  - What external courses or educational resources did I use to skill up?

I had to learn a ton about Dev-Ops. I didn't know anything about that. Tools like Kafka. This is when I got into the data conferences and blogs because I realized there was so much shit I didn't know.
