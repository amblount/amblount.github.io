# My Work Experience
I have a LOT of different work experience and it is difficult for other to understand what it is that I have done and how it fits into some chronological order. The truth is
the experiences don't really have a logical order because most of my work is project based and I typically work on more than one project at a time. I also take unpaid work as 
seriously as I do paid work, so the project that were unpaid could have more in depth documetation than a paid position given the time spent working on the project and the skills acquired
from that experience.

In this document I will attemmpt to explain all of my technical work experience and the interpersonal and technical skills I learned during each experience. I hope that this document
is useful for others who are interested in understanding what I have done and how it plays into my larger skillset.

I am working on explaning in the written form what I have done and how I have contributed to each team I have been a part of. I realize there are early career professionals who are looking at my page and would like to model their page after my own so I would also like to provide a few resources for you to explore. 

#### Race and Technology a Research Series
Microsoft reserach gathered together a group of academics who are already doing work in the fields that explore the way that racial classifications have negative impacts in the work experience of people of color. I have been keeping up with these talks and I realized something important lately. While most of the professionals presenting their work are social scientists and I am not, they have done a phenomenal job of using metrics and data to analyze trends and interpret the field in which they are working. The most critical part of their work is explaining their findinds to the rest of us, via books, papers, and talks. As I watched some of the talks I realized the presenters were also breaking down reserach methods and qualitative studies which were a required part of their job.

If you are an up and coming data professional I would encourage you to watch one or two of these talks and take note of the way these presenters talk about the research processes that have lead up to thier findings and incorate that method of explaining into your own portfolio.
