This was my first research project with a research group. I worked with Children's Hospital and Research Center in Oakland in the Ames Lab. It is interesting to think about the synergy of computer science, data science, chemistry, biology, and pathology. I think that it is important for technologists to think about domain specificity because it helps to think about problems deeply and come up with creative solutions. I think that biotechnology will really shape the way that the future world functions. I think that this is represented in an interesting way in the Netflix show Altered Carbon.


At the time of this research project the lab was working on creating a single nutrient bar which would provide all of the nutrients a human needs for the day. This bar ideally should be very cheap to produce and should help those dealing with extreme poverty and starvation, it should complement a meal of rice. This particular project looked at the metabolite in a blood sample to understand and map human health. I see myself probably going back into biotech research.

EZ fast assay
Statement of hypothesis

Differential H/D Isopropanol labeling will enable rapid and sensitive metabolite profiling method for absolute and relative quantification of amino and organic acids.

Specific aims

1. Determine the specific derivatization products of amino- and organic acids derived from isopropylchloroformate derivation with H-isopropanol or Deuterated (D)-isopropanol stable isotope.

2. Determine the optimal mass spectrometric setting to optimize instrument detection response to derivatized products.

Background

Amino and organic acid classes of metabolites are important for cellular energy, antioxidant, and inflammation homeostasis. Perturbations in their balance may be useful as sensitive biomarkers to study biological status relevant to human disease conditions.

Amino and organic acids in biological fluids (e.g., plasma, urine), cells and tissues are highly polar and their concentrations vary widely from low nM to high mM quantities. Chromatographic challenge of detecting polar compounds can be solved by derivatizing with alkylchloroformates, such as isopropylchloroformate (IPCF). IPCF derivation also enhances the detection of low abundance molecules by increasing ionization efficiency and mass spectrometric detection sensitivity.

Figure 1. Isopropylchloroformate (IPCF) Derivatization Chemistry

IPCF derivation chemistry is shown in Figure 1. Using cysteine as an example, it is shown that IPCF effectively alkylates the amine-, sulfhydryl- and the carboxyl- functional groups and forms a final derivatized product with m/z of 336.2 (Panel A). The mass spectra of the derivatized product (panel B, bottom) shows the complete conversion of cysteine to its final product. IPCF-modified cysteine can further be fragmented with neutral gas molecules to derive daughter fragments. The specific parent to daughter mass transitions can be used to sensitively and specifically quantify cysteine following chromatographic separation by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC).

The aim of this project is to test the suitability of using deutrated isopropanol (IP)

Figure 2. Differential labeling with "light" and "heavy" isopropanol.

As shown in figure 2, the use of IP or heavy IP will generate cysteine-IPCF derivatives that are structurally identical but have a mass difference of +7 mass units. Because they are structurally identical, their chromatographic behaviors will be identical (shown in the inset).

To begin to establish this method, I plan to use pure chemical standards and react them with IPCF with light IP and heavy IP and confirm the final derivative mass will be identical to that predicted by their reaction. As a second step, I will be responsible for optimizing the cone and collision energy to obtain the best signal using mass spectrometry.

Methods

The derivatization reaction will be initiated by adding 34 μL pyridine and 20 μL isopropylchloroformate (IPCF) and 60 µl of light or heavy IP to the glass reaction vial. The reaction mixture is vortexed for 30 sec before another 20-μL portion of IPCF is added again followed by 30-sec of vortexing. To extract the organic acid IPCF derivatives, 400 μL dichloromethane and 500 μL sodium carbonate-bi-carbonate solution (1 M) will be added to the reaction mixture followed by vortexing for 15 sec. After standing for 1 min to reach phase equilibrium, the upper aqueous layer is discarded. The bottom dichloromethane layer will be collected and evaporated to dryness under blowing nitrogen (Approx. 5 min). The dried organic layer will be reconstituted in 100 μL mobile phase prior to sample analysis using LC tandem mass spectrometry. 

Liquid chromatography will be performed using a Shimadzu HPLC system (Shimadzu, Columbia, MA) and an EZ:faast 3μ AAA-MS 150 x 3.0mm column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). The column will be operated at ambient temperature. The mobile phase is methanol-water (40:60 v/v) containing 10 mM ammonium formate at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min.

The entire eluate was monitored using a Waters Micromass Quattro LC triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Waters, Milford, MA) equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source. Masslynx and Quanlynx software (Waters, Milford, MA) were used for system control and data processing. The source temperature and capillary temperature were kept at 130 °C and 350 °C. Organic acid derivatives in the eluate were detected in positive ion mode using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). Optimum MRM transition and collision energy will be selected for each organic acid derivative using direct flow injection.

Anticipated outcome of project

Development of differential labeling chemistry with light and heavy IP will lower variations in quantification by 1) improving internal standardization of the metabolites, 2) provides means to obtain relative quantification of analytes in two different samples in a single injection run, and facilitate more accurate analysis of metabolites from complex biological samples.

isotope along with IPCF to differentially label metabolites (Figure 2). Differentially labeling metabolites with normal IP and deutrated IP (heavy IP) will increase the precision and accuracy of detection by providing internal standardization of each compound without the need for purchasing expensive specific stable isotopes.
