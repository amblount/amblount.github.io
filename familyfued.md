#### I can only speak for me

I guess it starts with disposable income, my mom had LOTS of disposable income because of my [godfather](), he paid for everything including private school tuition for preschool. For some reason poor black families don't put their children in preschool. Maybe its cultural and they don't understand the IMPACT of preschool, but it's like really important. Children NEED to be socialized around other children in their age group. They need love and support at home but they also need social skills around people, [READ OTHER HUMAN CHILDREN] who are alive and functioning at their current level of understanding.
