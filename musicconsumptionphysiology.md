This is actually my first independent research project, which I recently found from the General Human Biology lab I took while on campus at University. I thought it would be interesting to share this here because of the reaction the project got from the instructor and the class. The instructor felt the project was stupid and the class thought I didn't know how to spell. Let this be a lesson to you all, don't make presumptions about things you don't understand, simply ask. Turns out some people think this is an interesting area of research - the irony of being the only in a certain space.

Music Melody
Hypothesis:

Music has the potential to increase or decrease the heart rate of individuals based of their music preference.

Background:

Music has the potential to produce euphoric effects in terms of human physiology specifically change the heart rate by placing the listener in a pleasant state of mind. This is dependent on the listener preference. If the genre, quality, atmosphere, pitch, and resonance are all of a desirable state then the heart rate of the listener will decrease. This is a preferable physiological effect because a mammalian heart only as the potential for a maximum number of beats and one of the reasons humans live longer than other mammals is because our hearts beat at a slower pace. On the other hand if the sound quality of a certain style of music is not desirable for the listener the experience  should increase the subjects heart rate due to stress. I think that external stimulus will have an effect on the heart rate by interfering with the brain activity and distracting the participant from concentrating solely on the sound waves coming through the speakers.

Set Up:

A baseline set of vitals will have to be established for each of the ten participants in each of the two environments before any music is played. On of the locations will be an isolated room with myself and the participant and another will be a neutral outdoor location with other people interacting. A set of headphones and my i-pod will be used to play a playlist of four selected songs of four different genres and after each song is played another set of vital will be recorded. This will be repeated in the outdoor location with four similar but not identical songs so that familiarity with the songs is not established.

Materials:

8 songs downloaded into i-tunes

earphones

Background on taking a pulse - Pulse Measurement

Your pulse is the rate at which your heart beats. Your pulse is usually called your heart rate, which is the number of times your heart beats each minute (bpm). But the rhythm and strength of the heartbeat can also be noted, as well as whether the blood vessel feels hard or soft. Changes in your heart rate or rhythm, a weak pulse, or a hard blood vessel may be caused by heart disease or another problem.

As your heart pumps blood through your body, you can feel a pulsing in some of the blood vessels close to the skin's surface, such as in your wrist, neck, or upper arm. Counting your pulse rate is a simple way to find out how fast your heart is beating.

Your doctor will usually check your pulse during a physical examination or in an emergency, but you can easily learn to check your own pulse . You can check your pulse the first thing in the morning, just after you wake up but before you get out of bed. This is called a resting pulse. Some people like to check their pulse before and after they exercise.

You check your pulse rate by counting the beats in a set period of time (at least 15 to 20 seconds) and multiplying that number to get the number of beats per minute. Your pulse changes from minute to minute. It will be faster when you exercise, have a fever, or are under stress. It will be slower when you are resting.

Methods:

Surveyed 20 participants who were split into two groups (A, B) and answered the following questions then listened to the song, 'The Zone" - by the artist the Weeknd on an i-pod. During the year of this experiment the weeknd was an underground artist sharing his music on sound-cloud for free via mixtapes and ding live shows. I follow the underground scene so I was familiar with his work and had all three mixtapes at the time. This was a new genre of music and he was one of the first artists at the time speaking openly about promiscuity and pride. It was a fair to assume that none of the other students in the class would be familiar with the artist.

Each subject listened to ‚ÄúThe Zone‚Äù for 60 seconds on the i-pod and their heart rate was recorded before and after.

Two different groups of ten subjects were tested and facial expressions were recorded for each subject.

Group A - used white apple ear buds to listen to the song and each subject was attached to a Biopac computer software program.


The program measures systolic and diastolic heart rate and sensors were used to capture readings on the right and left radial veins and the carotid artery. Group A subjects were informed that alcohol swabs were required to clean the area the sensors were to be placed on and before the sensors were stuck to the right radial pulse a palpated pulse was measured for 30 seconds and multiplied by 2. The song was played for 60 seconds, while facial expression were recorded immediately followed by a second radial pulse measurement which was recorded for 15 seconds and multiplied by 4 to give a heart rate per minute reading.  The earbud‚Äôs were left inside the subjects ear while the second reading was recorded. The sensors were removed and tossed in the trashcan and the subject was asked to answer question number 8 on the survey describing their feelings about the song.

Group B subjects used sentry head art headphones and an automatic blood pressure cuff monitor (Rite Aid brand, superior accuracy described on box) to measure the heart rate.


The blood pressure cuff was open and placed above the brachial artery on the right arm and the start button was pressed. After about 15 seconds the monitor displayed a reading of the systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings and a pulse. The pulse reading was recorded and the initial pulse reading. The headphones were then handed to the subject and the song, ‚ÄúThe Zone‚Äù played for 60 seconds. Facial expressions were recorded and the blood pressure cuff remained on the subjects arms for the duration of the songs playing time. With the equipment still in tact the start button was again pressed and the pulse reading was recorded after the song. The blood pressure cuff and headphones were removed and the subjects were asked to answer question 8 on the survey.

All subjects in the data set were photographed and given a number to annonymize the data during analysis, this number is used the data to refer to specific cases.
