Hi, My name is, (I can read), I went to University of, (Listed in Profile), I studied (Listed Under Section Entitled Major)...
How do you market yourself in today's society? (LinkedIn) Everyone has a profile but how much does that profile really speak to who you are as a person? What are your strengths, weaknesses, what exactly do you bring to the table for the company that you would like to work with? These are all questions that were covered at Accelerate U, an informational hands-on seminar exploring the ways job seekers can use human interaction and exploration of their own networks to optimize the job seeking experience. The event was held at the new LinkedIn office in San Francisco in collaboration with Koru.

I wonder how many job seekers think about the power of their personal story? Let's talk about the story of goldilocks and the three bears, I think most are familiar with the story. If you leave out the portion of the story about escapism, you can take away the message of finding the right fit for yourself. In the job market, you can find the right company and position that aligns with your life mission (of the moment if you are similar to me). (-^_^-) All three bears in the story are different sizes and have different sizes of porridge and different bed sizes. When Goldilocks finds the right size for herself, she is a happy camper and falls asleep with a full stomach in a comfortable bed. (sounds like the life to me)

Great, find the right fit, but how would one apply this to their own life or interview?

The next time an interviewer ask you a question tell a story using the START model.

Here is a quick example.

Question: Alivia, How did you get to the Accelerate U event?

Answer: I live in Oakland, so I thought I would drive to the event but parking in San Francisco would cost about $27 for a 6 hour day. I had to figure out another way to get there given I did not want to spend that much in addition to toll and gas. I thought about using AC Transit to get to BART but I had to make sure I got up in enough time. According to Google Transit, my trip would take about 1 hour total and I saved the trip as an image on my phone. After walking to the bus stop at the stated time and calling 511 to check the Departure Time for my stop, I had a 19-minute wait. I didn't want to be late so I needed to take action, and I called an Uber. Just so happens the pool rider was heading to West Oakland Bart Station and so instead of paying $16 for a commute all the way across the bridge I got off at BART. I arrived at LinkedIn around 9:50 and had enough time to check in and get breakfast. So I took BART and Uber the event.

The event also featured a technical breakout from Zaid Ali Khan who gave invaluable advice for technical interviews and how to prepare for them.

Research the company, and ask GREAT questions.

Coding Style
Use short, but descriptive names for variables
Add Comments, especially on computer
Think Completeness in code
Exceptions often better than return code
Wrapping often better than inheriting
3. Coding Questions


4. Understand data structures


5. Algorithms



6. Whiteboarding


7. Number Theory


8. Networks and Distributed Systems


This was all so useful for me but also a little overwhelming.


A few LinkedIn employees came up to me after and gave me some wonderful advice.

" You have a fantastic education and employers want to hire you. Don't lower the bar for yourself."
They also shared a few helpful resources:

Project Euler
Cracking the Coding Interview
If you would like t brush up on your coding skills check out this Github CS curriculum and a cool Ted Talk.


I hope this helps.

Thank you LinkedIn for the fantastic event.
