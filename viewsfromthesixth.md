This is the 6th year of the Fellows program
I am so excited to be a code2040 fellow this year because I feel like within the tech community I finally found my people! I found female undergraduates from other parts of the country who are interested in machine learning. I found black male PhDs with whom I can discuss research papers. I found the other colored people and it feels amazing.

If you are unfamiliar with code2040, it's a non-profit organization whose mission is:

Code2040 creates pathways to success for Black and Latinx people in the innovation economy.
Our Mission

GOAL: We believe that Black and Latinx people are powerful innovators. Our Bold Goal is that, by 2040, we are recognized and valued as such, we are leading benefactors to and beneficiaries of the innovation economy, and we have the economic and social capital we need to thrive and to build generational wealth.

VISION: We believe the nation as a whole will be stronger when the contributions of communities of color are sought out and included within the innovation economy. As result, in 2040, we envision a nation as a whole that is more equitable, innovative, and prosperous.

In 2040, Black and Latinx people are recognized and valued as powerful architects of technological, economic, and societal innovations. We are visible and prolific in the Innovation Economy. We are hugely successful across a wide range of metrics, within and beyond the Innovation Economy. Black and Latinx people's unique contributions are sought after and we have the power to pursue whatever career paths and opportunities we want. We see our success as possible and believable and know that—without a doubt—we are capable. In 2040, Black and Latinx people succeed by being who we are, not by leaving parts of our identities behind.

This past weekend June 23 - 26 all the fellows came together to meet one another and the code2040 team for the first time at Dogpatch Studios in San Francisco. There were so many students from different schools, the diversity there was really interesting. Some students were from the Ivy League schools, State Schools, and HBCU's. Some students were undergraduate students and other were really far into Ph.D. programs, but we are all engineers and we spent part of the weekend talking about intersectionality and our passion for building software solutions.

From this past weekend I will remember all of the builders in the room, every one of the 135 fellows will go on to found a company or become a senior engineer somewhere, and they started from where I started from, their background is similar to my own, their feelings of imposter syndrome are similar to my own.

This weekend was a reminder that I belong in tech and I am part of building the future that we are living in.
