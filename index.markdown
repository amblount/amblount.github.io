### My name is ALIVIA BLOUNT
I am not sure how you found this space but I am happy you are here. I decided to create a table of common links, so it's a bit simpler to find stuff here.

#### Lets clarify some stuff
I am not pro or anti anyone but myself, as in I am PRO-Alivia, and I don't really have much of an interest in anyone else because I'm great and thats it. Also on most political issues I am moderate as so I am not super-liberal and not super-conservative I think both sides are bugging and are out of touch with society. I do have strong feelings about immigration because of cross-cultural communication and the way some (most) groups are unwilling to learn and integrate into mainstream society, this is why and how counter-culture has become mainstream - enter Cardi B. It's important to think about womens issues and women's issues globally. Women of color globally are in a difficult space and Black women in particular have it so rough, I am extra-empathetic to this group.

#### My Current Project
I have decided to create a film. I have a camera and I guess I have to be the representation that I seek in the world like always so, FUCK! Anyway, I am turning a Thandie Newton Interview into a film. I have acted out the scenes in this film. You should totally watch along. Its been a blast making this art. I want to take you guys inside the actors studio because I am just that artistic bitch.

#### Poverty...

- literacy
- food access
- lack of affordable housing

Black and Latino and now Arab communties are clustered into low income housing projects and they don't have access to anyone from the middle class or the upper middle class and there is a real culture and race gap. If you don't live in it or work near it, you don't see it. I learned about it first hand from my year as an Americorp Volunteer.

People you should listen to if you care about poverty:

- Idaline Bobe

Idalin grew up poor in Philly and she had just an aweful public school educational experience. It was just really bad. Watch the video for yourself to hear about it. I think so many people in communities of color have had awful experiences with institutions and so there is this belief that its supposed to be this way. The country has to make a conscious decision to educate the poor or it will lose big time because CHINA. I'm not very invested in the future of America so I don't really care, but as a person who is very familiar with Kumon and the Chinese work ethic, America better watch out because the mediocre dream is about to collapse.

- Jeff Duncan

He started a school in Oakland that he named after a Tupac song, "Roses in The Concrete" this is becuase he noticed all of the youth in Oakland were trauma informed and struggling so he wanted to change that. He created a charter school, but there are a ton of charter schools in Oakland that are taking resources away from Public School so that is a thing.

### I have done cool stuff
I have worked at a lot of large companies on really cool projects.
I am most proud of the work I did with:
- Facebook Developer Circles, I was able to Travel to Tunis, Tunisia (Africa), Business Class and learn a TON about the developing world
- Owning a Data Science Project end-to-end with Acorns
- Working on my own music sentiment analysis project - [Sentify]()

I am working towards admissions into a computer science PhD program. But I live independently from my family so I financially support myself and don't want to live under the poverty line. This is why the work experience section of my profile continue to grow.

### How I got here...

Honestly, I never saw myself as a researcher.

I made a lot of mistakes getting to where I am now, I tried to share a few of my insights with high school students a few weeks ago and I hope this information is ueful to someone.

### Yeah and.

I guess everybody likes technology now a days and you can pretty much find most things on the internet for free and that is all well and good. I am interested in pursuing a career in artificial intelligence research. I definitely did not think that I would be a person able to pursue a career in research because I did not grow up around researchers. But given the fact that I love asking questions and answering questions and generally thinking about thinking, I know that this is the path for me. 
![Image of places I've worked](/images/visualNoteImg.jpg)

Even though I was able to work at all of these really cool companies and travel around the world somewhat, I still felt like I had a surface level understanding
of data science and artificial intelligence and this just didn't feel right. I felt incomplete and not well read - so I figured if I am going to be the next
[Yoshua Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org/) - I had better get to reading a publishing just like the greats. But if what have done so far is intersting to you checkout this talk - I speak about how I virtually hacked my way into data science. As a Black American, getting a large technology company to pay for me to travel to Africa was like a literal dream come true.
