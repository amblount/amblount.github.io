### My name is ALIVIA BLOUNT
I am not sure how you found this space but I am happy you are here. I decided to create a table of common links, so it's a bit simpler to find stuff here.

### I have done cool stuff
I have worked at a lot of large companies on really cool projects.
I am most proud of the work I did with:
- Facebook Developer Circles, I was able to Travel to Tunis, Tunisia (Africa), Business Class and learn a TON about the developing world
- Owning a Data Science Project end-to-end with Acorns
- Working on my own music sentiment analysis project - [Sentify]()

I am working towards admissions into a computer science PhD program. But I live independently from my family so I financially support myself and don't want to live under the poverty line. This is why the work experience section of my profile continue to grow.

### How I got here...

Honestly, I never saw myself as a researcher.

I made a lot of mistakes getting to where I am now, I tried to share a few of my insights with high school students a few weeks ago and I hope this information is ueful to someone.

### Yeah and.

I guess everybody likes technology now a days and you can pretty much find most things on the internet for free and that is all well and good. I am interested in pursuing a career in artificial intelligence research. I definitely did not think that I would be a person able to pursue a career in research because I did not grow up around researchers. But given the fact that I love asking questions and answering questions and generally thinking about thinking, I know that this is the path for me.

Even though I was able to work at all of these really cool companies and travel around the world somewhat, I still felt like I had a surface level understanding
of data science and artificial intelligence and this just didn't feel right. I felt incomplete and not well read - so I figured if I am going to be the next
[Yoshua Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org/) - I had better get to reading a publishing just like the greats. But if what have done so far is intersting to you checkout this talk - I speak about how I virtually hacked my way into data science. As a Black American, getting a large technology company to pay for me to travel to Africa was like a literal dream come true.
