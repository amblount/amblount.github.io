Honestly, I never saw myself as a researcher.

I made a lot of mistakes getting to where I am now, I tried to share a few of my insights with high school students a few weeks ago and I hope this information is ueful to someone.

## Yeah and.

I guess everybody likes technology now a days and you can pretty much find most things on the internet for free and that is all well and good. I am interested in pursuing a career in artificial intelligence research. I definitely did not think that I would be a person able to pursue a career in research because I did not grow up around researchers. But given the fact that I love asking questions and answering questions and generally thinking about thinking, I know that this is the path for me.

Along my very weird journey into research and traditional academia I have done some really cool things and had some amazing experiences.

Even though I was able to work at all of these really cool companies and travel around the world somewhat, I still felt like I had a surface level understanding
of data science and artificial intelligence and this just didn't feel right. I felt incomplete and not well read - so I figured if I am going to be the next
[Yoshua Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org/) - I had better get to reading a publishing just like the greats. But if what have done so far is intersting to you checkout this talk - I speak about how I virtually hacked my way into data science. As a Black American, getting a large technology company to pay for me to travel to Africa was like a literal dream come true.
