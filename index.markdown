Honestly, I never saw myself as a researcher.

I made a lot of mistakes getting to where I am now, I tried to share a few of my insights with high school students a few weeks ago and I hope this information is ueful to someone.

## Yeah and.

I guess everybody likes technology now a days and you can pretty much find most things on the internet for free and that is all well and good. I am interested in pursuing a career in artificial intelligence research. I definitely did not think that I would be a person able to pursue a career in research because I did not grow up around researchers. But given the fact that I love asking questions and answering questions and generally thinking about thinking, I know that this is the path for me. 

## Current Research Interests

- meta-reinforcement learing
- causal inference
- explainable AI
- openendedness
