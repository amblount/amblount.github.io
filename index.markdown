### My name is ALIVIA BLOUNT
I am not sure how you found this space but I am happy you are here. I decided to create a table of common links, so it's a bit simpler to find stuff here.

#### Lets clarify some stuff
I am not pro or anti anyone but myself, as in I am PRO-Alivia, and I don't really have much of an interest in anyone else because I'm great and thats it. Also on most political issues I am moderate as so I am not super-liberal and not super-conservative I think both sides are bugging and are out of touch with society. I do have strong feelings about immigration because of cross-cultural communication and the way some (most) groups are unwilling to learn and integrate into mainstream society, this is why and how counter-culture has become mainstream - enter Cardi B. It's important to think about womens issues and women's issues globally. Women of color globally are in a difficult space and Black women in particular have it so rough, I am extra-empathetic to this group.

#### Social Issues

A mini blurb from July 12, 2022 [Update]

##### All the things

I am not a trained journalist and I am in the beginning stages of finding my voice and my perspective and I am doing this in spite of a lot. I feel like I am just starting to realize how to use certain systems and what proper ‘citizenship’ is supposed to look like and it feels weird. It feels weird to honestly try to navigate society as an adult black person. 

I am so glad that despite how controversial some of the things that I have said in the past are and how offensive they are, I had the confidence to say them. If I didn’t say those things and express those thoughts, YES, maybe some people wouldn’t have been offended and their hurt feelings could have been spared, but those thoughts and feelings were coming from a real place in my real life and I am not going to apologize for that. I think that if you find another persons thoughts and feelings offensive YOU should take the time to try and correct or inform that person if you would like them to understand but there is this weird space where people feel like they would convince and take control of other peoples thoughts and I am NOT for that. Free speech is important and you need to be able to express your honest opinions on topics of the day and it it perfectly normal to disagree with someone else.

##### On Work
It’s awful

#On culture and society
I feel like I have spoken about this a lot and it is something that continues to be important to and for me because I have come across so many different cultures and people in work and in society unfortunately for me many of those experiences have not been positive and I wish they had. I can’t ignore the many forms of bias and opportunity that I have been afforded but when I think about it, it hasn’t really led me to have this positive outlook on this society as a place in which I would want to live and that I why I am moving on.

I feel like American culture is competitive at its core and that it not necessarily a bad thing, but I think that it has the ability to become toxic when opportunities are given to certain groups and taken from others which is the unfortunate reality. The biggest example that I can think of is middle class education and the ways that money can buy a positive personalized learning environment for some which continuing to be out of reach for a large majority of Americans. Education is the one system which could potentially equalize the life chances for many and enable all people despite their socio-economic upbringing to experience a life worth living. Adults have the ability to gain a skill and use that skill in the marketplace to support a family and pay for their cost of living. I can’t seem to rationalize why this sort of adult experience would or is out of reach for some people here just because they are black, when the black experience in this country has been so full of anguish and trauma. As a society wouldn’t we try an rectify some of those wrongs, but i feel like I am probably speaking to a wall and no one actually cares about that in reality its like a theoretical problem that most of American can think vaguely about without actually taking ANY action to solve this problem. Its weird.

##### On America
What if you are too exhausted to play the I am racialized card and try to advocate for yourself and humanize yourself and your real lived experience. What then? That doesn’t seem to fit in with what has been expected. Critical thinkers are not invited to the cookout tne BBQ or the event period. One thought that is out of the ordinary or is not understood by the masses and you are out, “WE” can not accept this form of intolerance and someone that is so different from what we are used to. This is my interpretation of the community and society which currently see and just don’t accept.

##### On extreme wealth and a lack of equity -= America…
To watch celebrities spend $300,000 on their girlfriends weekly allowance and other celebrities lose $21,000,000 gambling overnight is just ridiculous. It just hurtful and show such a lack of compassion for most people and their struggle to survive. I care about the issue but honestly I feel like I am the only one.

##### Saying ALL the unpopular things
Last year, I brought up some really controversial topics that sounded racist to some people and homophobic to others but they were real conversations that I was tired of having in private and I wanted to know the answers to. I am so happy to see many people actually talking about these topics openly and with respect for differing perspectives on platforms like Jubillee and youtube. I think that society will move forward as long as the conversations continue.

I also had a lot of questions about relationships and black women in general particularly around fetishization. It felt like there were a very loud percentage of black men who were so free in their hate towards black women and it was strange. I tried to ask a few people about this last year but that conversation didn’t go very far. Yet, Iam still very happy that I tried because what is a question if left unanswered. This is yout life to live and I think that its up to you to get your questions about society answered. 

##### Starting Over in Germany
I think, I know I am ready for a change because I can take all that I have learned over the past few months and years and apply that information to my future and grow. I do truely believe in growth, even if you think that I lack the potential to grow, I di and you do as well.

##### What I’ve learned from it all
You can’t be afraid to ask a question and have a feeling about ANY topic. There might be something in your upbringing that made you feel a particular way and brought you some discomfort. A part of the human experience is getting to the root of why you feel that way and thinking through what you can do to change those feelings. Saying a word aloud and expressing your thoughts about something doesn’t make you a bad person, it actually makes you an honest person and you have the right to be honest and human. Take that seriously even if others won’t.


#### My Current Project
I have decided to create a film. I have a camera and I guess I have to be the representation that I seek in the world like always so, FUCK! Anyway, I am turning a Thandie Newton Interview into a film. I have acted out the scenes in this film. You should totally watch along. Its been a blast making this art. I want to take you guys inside the actors studio because I am just that artistic bitch.

#### Poverty...

- literacy
- food access
- lack of affordable housing

Black and Latino and now Arab communties are clustered into low income housing projects and they don't have access to anyone from the middle class or the upper middle class and there is a real culture and race gap. If you don't live in it or work near it, you don't see it. I learned about it first hand from my year as an Americorp Volunteer.

People you should listen to if you care about poverty:

- Idaline Bobe

Idalin grew up poor in Philly and she had just an aweful public school educational experience. It was just really bad. Watch the video for yourself to hear about it. I think so many people in communities of color have had awful experiences with institutions and so there is this belief that its supposed to be this way. The country has to make a conscious decision to educate the poor or it will lose big time because CHINA. I'm not very invested in the future of America so I don't really care, but as a person who is very familiar with Kumon and the Chinese work ethic, America better watch out because the mediocre dream is about to collapse.

- Jeff Duncan

He started a school in Oakland that he named after a Tupac song, "Roses in The Concrete" this is becuase he noticed all of the youth in Oakland were trauma informed and struggling so he wanted to change that. He created a charter school, but there are a ton of charter schools in Oakland that are taking resources away from Public School so that is a thing.

### I have done cool stuff
I have worked at a lot of large companies on really cool projects.
I am most proud of the work I did with:
- Facebook Developer Circles, I was able to Travel to Tunis, Tunisia (Africa), Business Class and learn a TON about the developing world
- Owning a Data Science Project end-to-end with Acorns
- Working on my own music sentiment analysis project - [Sentify]()

I am working towards admissions into a computer science PhD program. But I live independently from my family so I financially support myself and don't want to live under the poverty line. This is why the work experience section of my profile continue to grow.

### How I got here...

Honestly, I never saw myself as a researcher.

I made a lot of mistakes getting to where I am now, I tried to share a few of my insights with high school students a few weeks ago and I hope this information is ueful to someone.

### Yeah and.

I guess everybody likes technology now a days and you can pretty much find most things on the internet for free and that is all well and good. I am interested in pursuing a career in artificial intelligence research. I definitely did not think that I would be a person able to pursue a career in research because I did not grow up around researchers. But given the fact that I love asking questions and answering questions and generally thinking about thinking, I know that this is the path for me. 
![Image of places I've worked](/images/visualNoteImg.jpg)

Even though I was able to work at all of these really cool companies and travel around the world somewhat, I still felt like I had a surface level understanding
of data science and artificial intelligence and this just didn't feel right. I felt incomplete and not well read - so I figured if I am going to be the next
[Yoshua Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org/) - I had better get to reading a publishing just like the greats. But if what have done so far is intersting to you checkout this talk - I speak about how I virtually hacked my way into data science. As a Black American, getting a large technology company to pay for me to travel to Africa was like a literal dream come true.
