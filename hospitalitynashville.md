# Moving to Nashville

I knew that I wanted a job in the hospitality industry but I didn't know much else. I thought you needed all of this experience and so while I was in the bay area I worked as a server for a catering company.
If you are in the bay are you should apply with the catering company and gain some valuable fina dining experience. I worked with [Paula Le Duc](https://www.paulaleduc.com/careers).

## Things I wish I knew

1. being a [SERVER] is a BIG deal. You need to learn the menu, and I mean memorize the menu and be able to talk about food and wine pairing. People take breakfast, lunch, and dinner seriously and eat out EVERYDAY. This is a great thing is you are nice and willing to work. But you are going to HAVE to work your way up the ladder. Just start as a serving assistant.

2. Servers are bitches and bartenders can be cocky

3. TIPS, you can actually live off of the wages you earn from TIPS

4. Dolly Parton had a point

5. Go to the BAR and purchase one cocktail after work, go alone at first and then make friends over time. The first few weeks don't go home wih anyone, just take yourself out and purchase dessert or a cocktail the bars are open until 3:00 AM.

## What the HELL is a server assistant
A server assistant is the first person to greet the guest once they sit down at the table. The host is the person who seats the guest. The server assistant pours the water and brings over the breadsticks and other free stuff before the guest orders anything. They just smile at the guest. They can also be food runners who will bring food from the kitchen to the table but that requires you know the dishes on the menu and that takes a few weeks. If you are a new person you probably will only touch water. When the restaurant gets busy there are a lot of table who will need water at the same time and you will have to prioritize. When tables go from one course to another it is your responsibility to bring out new dishware and set the table. If there are 10 guests at the table you are responsible for setting that many places at the table and you can only hold so many plates in yu
