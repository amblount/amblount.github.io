# Moving to Nashville

I knew that I wanted a job in the hospitality industry but I didn't know much else. I thought you needed all of this experience and so while I was in the bay area I worked as a server for a catering company.
If you are in the bay are you should apply with the catering company and gain some valuable fina dining experience. I worked with [Paula Le Duc](https://www.paulaleduc.com/careers).
