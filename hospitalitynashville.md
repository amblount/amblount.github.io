# Moving to Nashville

I knew that I wanted a job in the hospitality industry but I didn't know much else. I thought you needed all of this experience and so while I was in the bay area I worked as a server for a catering company.
If you are in the bay are you should apply with the catering company and gain some valuable fina dining experience. I worked with [Paula Le Duc](https://www.paulaleduc.com/careers).

## Things I wish I knew

1. being a [SERVER] is a BIG deal. You need to learn the menu, and I mean memorize the menu and be able to talk about food and wine pairing. People take breakfast, lunch, and dinner seriously and eat out EVERYDAY. This is a great thing is you are nice and willing to work. But you are going to HAVE to work your way up the ladder. Just start as a serving assistant.

2. Servers are bitches and bartenders can be cocky

3. TIPS, you can actually live off of the wages you earn from TIPS

4. Dolly Parton had a point

5. Go to the BAR and purchase one cocktail after work, go alone at first and then make friends over time. The first few weeks don't go home wih anyone, just take yourself out and purchase dessert or a cocktail the bars are open until 3:00 AM.
