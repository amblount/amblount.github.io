# Ethiopia

### What do I know about the place?

Currently I don't know much from first hand experience, but over the last I would say 4 years, I have been gathering data and interviewing Habesha people to learn more. 

### Why do I care?

My father is Ethiopian and I think it is VERY important for me to understand more about my relationship to Africa given how critical my race has been to my lived experience. I have NEVER felt American and I have known for a long time America is NOT the country for me so I have been trying to connect with Ethiopica to live and work there. There seem to be many challenges on the continent like Internet, water, banking, farming, trade -- everything, but I would like to take myself and my skills there to improve the situation.

### Resources
Bloggers have been the most useeful resource for me given many live in Ethiopia and are sharing information about the cost of living and the culture there.

A few notable bloggers:

Each of these women has their own story wit ethiopia and watching them travel has been a very cool source of inspiiration for me. I just had no idea what it was like at all and now I feel like I ave some sort of starting point. I am not sure at the moment if I need to figure out EVERYTHING I think its more important to just go for the first time and sort of figure it out.

### Data Engineering
The big idea here for me is to think about development and how to turn some of the infrastructure challenges in the area into opportunities for developmment on the tech front by creating data products. I currently have this cool idea about creating a SNAP or digital funnding progrram for women and children who need money for food. There could be a few cool data products that come out of understanding the exact cost of food for a month for women living alone in Ethiopia in Addis especially. Understanding how these women are using public transit to get the food or ow much each product costs and which markets they are using to purchase the food. I have questions.

### [World Packers](https://www.worldpackers.com/) 
I recently learned about a website where you can volunteer abroad in exchange for lodging and there are a few oppotunities in Ethiopiia so hopefully if things work out the way I planned I will be able to check out Addid without having to worry about loding and learn a bit from locals at least for my first trip.
