At McDonald's - had some points on the app so I got a free meal. I bought cigarettes with the money my mom gave me for lunch. I wanted to buy dinner but i haven'y encouraged her to send me any money for that. Imagine that, an actual living mother who refuses to send her only living daughter $30 for dinner, what a #BICTH!

Also fucking McDonalds. I purchased a large sprite which caused me to freeze for real and I needed to pee. They put a code on the bathroom so you cant just walk in and there are two stalls. I get the mexican girl at the register to put in the code and I walk and and there is tissue all over the floor. There is a fat black mother who is also waiting for the bathroom and she jusy walks right in. I go back to the register and ask thm to pick up the tissue off of the floor. The mexican girl claims she is busy taking orders, is it the french fries I just ordered on the app? Whatever so another black woman who I meet l8r Tiffany goes in and picks up the tissue. I am having trouble holding my pee so I have a major attitude. I go back to my seat where I have out my laptop and text message my cousin Keisha to try and encourage her  her to send my mother a message so that she can send me dinner money, she doesn't even respond.

#### Women are not free
I realize now that It cost money for women to live and that cost is about $100 a day for meals.

## $30 for Breakfast

- Egg, bacon, chive cream cheese bagel
- coffee
- water bottle

## $30 for Lunch

- Pepperoni Pizza Slice
- Sprite soda

## $30 for Dinner

- Big Mac
- Large Sprite
- Medium Fries

And typically your parents should pay for those meals while you are a child. When you grow up you should be able to pay for that cost yourself. If for some reason your parents donâ€™t have the money to pay for those meals than someone else has to pay. I think this is why in high school as a freshman you should get a job and start paying for your own meals. If you do then you will realiz how much money things cost. When you go to college you understand your schedule and you understand that you have to pay for these meals for yourself or you are on a mealplan
