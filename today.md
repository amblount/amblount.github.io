Breakeven - the script

I realize now that It cost money for women to live and that cost is about $100 a day for meals.

$30 for breakfast
$30 for lunch
$30 for dinner

And typically your parents should pay for those meals while you are a child. When you grow up you should be able to pay for that cost yourself. If for some reason your parents donâ€™t have the money to pay for those meals than someone else has to pay. I think this is why in high school as a freshman you should get a job and start paying for your own meals. If you do then you will realiz how much money things cost. When you go to college you understand your schedule and you understand that you have to pay for these meals for yourself or you are on a mealplan
