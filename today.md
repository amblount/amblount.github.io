At McDonald's - had some points on the app so I got a free meal. I bought cigarettes with the money my mom gave me for lunch. I wanted to buy dinner but i haven'y encouraged her to send me any money for that. Imagine that, an actual living mother who refuses to send her only living daughter $30 for dinner, what a #BICTH!

Also fucking McDonalds. I purchased a large sprite which caused me to freeze for real and I needed to pee. They put a code on the bathroom so you cant just walk in and there are two stalls. I get the mexican girl at the register to put in the code and I walk and and there is tissue all over the floor. There is a fat black mother who is also waiting for the bathroom and she jusy walks right in. I go back to the register and ask thm to pick up the tissue off of the floor. The mexican girl claims she is busy taking orders, is it the french fries I just ordered on the app? Whatever so another black woman who I meet l8r Tiffany goes in and picks up the tissue. I am having trouble holding my pee so I have a major attitude. I go back to my seat where I have out my laptop and text message my cousin Keisha to try and encourage her  her to send my mother a message so that she can send me dinner money, she doesn't even respond.

By the time I make it back to the bathroom, the fat womans daughter beat me into the stall. I had to wait for her to come out and I am about to piss my pants. Of course I have to ask for the code again. Once I go in there is period blood on the seat. I have to walk back out and ask the male attendant to clean the stall and he looks at me cross-eyed asking why he would be able to clean the womans restroom, he is right but I’m not sitting on a seat with blood so I ask Tiffany to clean it. She walks over to the closet to get some sort of cleaning product and gloves cleans the seat and I am finally able to pee. THANK GOD.

#### Women are not free
I realize now that It cost money for women to live and that cost is about $100 a day for meals.

Let's talk about discount Betty mothers for a moment. They always believe that products and services don't cost money even the bare minimum shit. It's pathetic. I am not asking for an expensive meal I am asking for McDondals and she won't even send me money for that. Like bro. $30 per meal is not a lot of money. She doesn't know how to budget anything at all and its insane. I think so many adult women should just get away from their families and have their own shit for so many reasons. Also the video from today where the man is making fun of women who have been dating broke men and the tears. I'm crying this is SO funny like serously.

## $30 for Breakfast

- Egg, bacon, chive cream cheese bagel
- coffee
- water bottle

## $30 for Lunch

- Pepperoni Pizza Slice
- Sprite soda

## $30 for Dinner

- Big Mac
- Large Sprite
- Medium Fries

And typically your parents should pay for those meals while you are a child. When you grow up you should be able to pay for that cost yourself. If for some reason your parents don’t have the money to pay for those meals than someone else has to pay. I think this is why in high school as a freshman you should get a job and start paying for your own meals. If you do then you will realiz how much money things cost. When you go to college you understand your schedule and you understand that you have to pay for these meals for yourself or you are on a mealplan
