I am officially in my adulting era and it feels very strange. I have been sort of doing it, but nothing like this. I have been turning on my camera every single day and talking about my feelings. I do have real feelings about things and that it weird to say aloud. I am sitting in a Starbucks coffee shop and I think I am going to download the app - I mean the Starbucks mobile app because I feel tapped in, in a way that I haven't ever felt before. I have always felt here, like I know that I am physically in the place with other people but I just don't feel like we are having a shared experience and I don't really feel like the other people care that I am here or that I exist. I guess this is why I have been blogging more, more than usual. I want to remind myself that I am real and that my experiences are valid.

> There is SO much to talk about.

Lets start with the selfie of the day.

### Future Forward

I was contacted by the American University of Rome in Italy I believe and that is pretty cool. 
There is also two grants that I would like to apply for. There is an [A16 black tides grant](https://info.a16z.com/apply-to-talent-x-opportunity.html) that helps black founders raise money and start a start-up. I would like to work on a new start-up called adulting that helps young adults get move out on their own and start their lives as adults with goals and financial planning help.

### Concerts Im saving for

- BEYONCE - RENAISSANCE
