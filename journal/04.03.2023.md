There are so many things that I don’t write down because I don’t think they are significant and I am tired of recording trauma porn. I don’t want anymore bad news at all. Like no bad news. I think that what some people consider a bad time I actually think is just a temporary inconvenience. There are so many things that I was once afraid of that I am not afraid of anymore because I have lived a bit longer and they just are not as significant. 

I am no longer happy for other peoples accomplishments and I don’t want to know about them because I don’t care. I only care about my own personal success. I only care about me. I figured I would make a mental note of this because I have gone through the search proces to find this song like 10x and I’m tired of searching for the same information. 

There is an episode of Girlfriends where the male character is wining to Joan about his father, I think the characters name is williams and he mentions a song where white kids are wining about their parents because that is acceptable in the white community but completely unacceptable in the black community. Watch the clip.

Anyway the song they are talking about is [PERFECT by SIMPLE PLAN] I am so gald I found this song and am finally writing about it.

I like this song for a few reasons, mostly because there is a kid making a song dedicated to his parents. Parents so commonly don’t listen to their kids and that shit sucks. You might be the kind of kid who really tries to do everything right and be the perfect kid but for whatever reason, it doesn’t work out and you don’t make it. I wish it wasn’t like this but it is. There are so many reasons why things might not go right for you and I certainly don’t have most or all of the answer to why this is is the case. It doesn’t really matter what the reasons are but the fact that you didn;’t get what you wanted is important and you should unpack that. There is probably someone out there who has a similar background to you and did actually get what they wanted, you could look to them and try to understand where you went wrong and try to fix it, or not. Sometimes it is less time consuming to just realize that things didn’t work out for you and you should actually just move on because it’s easier that way. 

There was a song playing at the winery tonight and I want to give it some time, it’s been a while by staind

> The consequences that I rendered. I stretched myself beyond my means.

This song is about an addict who missed his girlfriend. It sounds like she gave him a bunch of chances to change and he just never did and now he is loking back at pictures of her and thinking about how good it once was to be with her and how soecial it was. It is really sad when people lose the love of their lives due to drug addiction. I wish that more black women actually has a real love experience that was relatable to this so the song would make some sense but unfortunately so many people are in meaningless relationships with meaningless people and it all just amounts to nothing at all in terms of time well spent.

For some reason this band is reminding me of daughtry and simple plan. It makes me feel like there are actually men out in the world who do value women in some way, I don’t think I have ever met one of those men, but for some wome those men exist. I personally appreciate the fact that there is another human alive who has certain feelings but I don’t really live in the same world as those people so I could only imagine.

Other songs that have given me a similar feeling are Nickleback - How you remind me. I feel like this song tells the story of someone who lost someone special, and has a Maroon 5 sort of feel to it. It seems like

Time out, remember when Maroon 5 made a whole music video about how much the lead siger loves his supermodel wife and told her to take all he has? Yeah I remember that too. It was amazing. Like seriously amazing.
