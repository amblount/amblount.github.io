I didn't get the job. I'm not suprosied I didn't get the job I'm a bit more concerned because I don't understand who does get the job.
The old white women who apply and work on the administrative side of EVERYTHING in America are NOT qualified to work with the youth of color mostly black
and latino youth who do not respect or care for them and these are the women who are applying for roles in that sector. It's strange really. I don't think
of myself as the smartest person in the room but I'm not a fucking KAREN. I don't want to work with KARENS, but they are fucking EVERYWHERE and I
can't seem to escape them no matter how hard I try.

It's all exhausting really and it doesn't seem fair. I have formed my opinions and life views and values from my personal lived experiences. 

- RACE
- CLASS
- PRIVILEGE

have been really important topics in the course of my life and I can't just ignore those things. I am a human black female woman in the society and I have
skills and abilities, wants and desires and I deserve to have a quality life juts because I work hard and I am alive. That should be enough and for some
reason the society continues to give me feedback that it is not enough and I should be more in some way.

I've actually done SHIT. Like a lot of shit and I think that I should be rewarded with MONEY and JOB offers, but it seems like I can't have that?

### I'm talking about work

I've had jobs, like corporate jobs meaning I have work experience. I don't need another training program and I didn't really need one in the beginning its just
a bunch of bullshit and hoops but it doesn't seem like skill is actually what is valued. I worked hard to build a skillset and tell stories via data journalism.
That is what I like to do and that is what I am good at doing. It just bothers me when I feel like I am not able to do that for one or more reasons. 

### Note taking

Context is everything in note taking. You want to get down to the main points and think about who was there and why they were there and what was happening and it can
be difficult to infer this information from a set of bad notes. This is why I prefer pictures and video. Written text is nice but so many people are
awful writers and so it can be difficult to understand what they are talking about and what they are referring to when they write something. There are times when
I read a note from someone else and it feels like I'm missing something important, like why I shuld give a flying fuck in the first place. Honestly I just
don't care to read most of the shit people are writing about and I just think about myself and what I want and what I care about and that doesn't add up
to what other people are about and what they are writing about and what they are talking about. 

> No lie, I'm actually different

I just care about different shit, you know? I don't want to be like the other people, I just want to be like me and that has to be enough. Honeslty it is enough
but I need other people to literally leave me alone and stop bothering me. 

### CollEGE

I am becoming a better writer. I am writing a LOT more now than I was in the past and it's cool and useful. I am expressing my feelings in constructive ways.
I think that distancing myself from my family has really helped and I think that hvaing meaningful adult relationships with men has helped, but it may
have also hurt me in strange ways. It would be nice to go to college, to study at University and try and interact with people in new ways about topics that I care about.
I care about economics and society. I care about politics and I care about life, but mostly my life. I care about my LIFE a LOT, and this is why I have
lived my life in certain ways. 

### Malcolm X and his mother

I don't think many people know this story but Malcolm X lost both of his parents. His father was run over by a train and his mother was commited to a mental
institution. They were both PRO-black freedom fighters working towards civil rights in the United States. That fucking fight will never be over, EVER!
I will write more about this at a later time but right now I want to talk about the feelings wheel and MONEY.

### MONeY

Why won't they give the descendants of slaves money to leave. It doesn't feel like the country actually wants to integrate Black Americans so instead
of doing that why won't they give Black people money to leave. I would like to leave. I REFUSE to live my life as a second class citizen in this country
and NONE of the systems work for me. At EVERY SINGLe step, there is a need for me to revalidate and recertify and TRIPLE check. That shit is exhausting and I 
don't want to do it. I shouldn't have to do it. It doesn't make any sense.
