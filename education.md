# My name is Alivia and My educational path is NOT linear.
I am getting really tired of explaining the same story over and over again so instead I will just write it here and continue to update it. 
The reason this post is necessary is because I have done a LOT of learning via internships, online courses and actual work experience and I haven't really taken the opportunity to talk about that
