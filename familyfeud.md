#### I can only speak for me

 <img width=500 height=1000 style="float:right;" src="/images/firstpress.jpg"/> <p style="float:left;">I guess it starts with disposable income, my mom had LOTS of disposable income because of my [godfather](), he paid for everything including private school tuition for preschool. For some reason poor black families don't put their children in preschool. Maybe its cultural and they don't understand the IMPACT of preschool, but it's like really important. Children NEED to be socialized around other children in their age group. They need love and support at home but they also need social skills around people, [READ OTHER HUMAN CHILDREN] who are alive and functioning at their current level of understanding.</p>

#### Something changed with YouTube and content ownerzhip
I left a performing arts high school with no video content and no portfolio. That is [INSANE]! Do you guys know how difficult it is to gain admission into a performing arts program? Like many people want a spot but not everyone gets IN! You have to be better than like everyone else. Seriously. People who purchase tickets to the shows come because there is talent on stage. The tickets are NOT free. The kids who gain admission into the programs have [SERIOUS]() talent. When I left Oakland School for the Arts I knew I didn't want to be a struggling artist, meaning I didn't want to be poor
