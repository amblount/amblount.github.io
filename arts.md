What can I do to help?

If you know anything about me you know that I went to arts school. I was not always an academic. From K-12 I was heavily involved with the arts. I started at BAM (Berkeley Arts Magnet) where we had West African Dance class and instrumental music for about half the day. We also had theater and jewelry making. During the after school program we turned the playground into a skate park with scooters and bikes. Then I went Longfellow Arts and Technology school where we also had a ton of dance classes optional instrumental music and many after school clubs filled with arts. In sixth grade we had a portion of every day dedicated to art attack. I loved art attack, it was magical. Our teacher purchased a book about learning how to draw things and would lead us with an overhead projector and teach us how to draw everything from people to pencils. Out of this class, in 6th grade, I got a portfolio of art! I actually think that this art class may have been better than an art class I took in college!(no shade UCD)
