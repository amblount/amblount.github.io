  - What team or product did I work on?

Circuit Launch is a playground for roboticists. Many people come into the space to work on building their robotics start-ups and they host a fellowship where you can get hands on building a robot from scratch.

  - What was the impact of this project or team in relation to the company?

There was no company this was just a learning experience for me. I had so may questions about how the hardware and software play together in the field of robotics and I was only familiar with computer simulations. I didn't have any idea about how to build and robot and get it working.

  - Who did I work with?

In the lab there were roboticists who earned PhDs in robotics from UC Berkeley and other start up founders.

  - What assumptiosn did I make coming in?

I didn't know much about hardware at all. I didn't know what to expect.

  - What technology or tools did I use?

I paid attention to the hardware espects so I purposefully didn't work much on the software.

  - What hurdles did this team face?

Getting all the aspects to work together the hardware and the software can be difficult.

  - What was the outcome of the project?

We built Reachy the robot arm that could pick up a marker and write on the board.

  - What external courses or educational resources did I use to skill up?

There are courses on Coursera that teach introduction to robotics, those are in depth courses because they require you ro read through University two-term text books which describe complex topics in robotics.
