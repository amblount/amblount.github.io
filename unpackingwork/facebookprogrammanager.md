What team or product did I work on? 

Technically Developer Circles which was a part of the Strategic Partnerships Platform Team. The company META, or previously known as Faceboo is is it complicated to understand as a lay person because therre are SO many subsidiary projects or teams and every acquisition just makes this even more complicated. The major teams that people know about are:

- Facebook Web or Platform
- Facebook Mobile App
- Whatsapp
- Instagram
- Messenger

There are MANY others but lets starat there. If you are using your mobile phone and download the Facebook app from either the apple store or the google play store, you are interacting with a PRODUCT the mobile app team controls. This mostly had to do with design and engineering. Designing for web is very different from desinging for mobile but given the end user interacts with both products depending on where they are in the world and whata they aare doing, there need to be a seamless experience across both platforms. This means the same funnctionality you have on the web platform, in terms on commenting, posting, and sharing need to be seamless. On each of these teams you are going to have designers and engineers who are working to update and maintain the product in its current state. Web developers know how to build for the web and mobile app designers know how to build for mobile platforms. Both teams have analysts and data engineers who manage moving data for the team specifically. 

As a program manager you manager a particular program that one team probably owns and that team might build a number of different products. So the team that I worked with interacted with developers who were building products that interacted with thhe facebook app. The app is obviously a social platform and had an open API for developers to consume and produce data to integrate functions like login, or connect to enable end users for some downstream product to login vua facebook or view a friends list from the platform.
