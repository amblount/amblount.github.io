# Data Science Intern        |   Acorns | Irvine, CA | Fall 2017 

### What is Acorns? 

Acorns is a start-up financial technology company which aims to help millennials invest in the stock market by rounding up change from purchases made with debit cards. If you choose to sign up with Acorns, you connect your bank account to the platform and it uses the Plaid API (manages financial data on the transaction level) to understand how much money you spent. Say you spend $3.98 at Starbucks, the Acorns platform will round up your purchase spend to $4.00 and invest the $0.02 in mutual funds. This is a no hassle way for millennials to start investing. 

### What team or product did I work on? 

I was an intern on the data science team during the Fall. The data science team at the time consisted of PhD mathematicians who transitioned into data science proper and were learning how to use engineering software and tools to be effective with enterprise data.  

#### The Food Labeling Project 

I selected an intern project from a list of projects in the backlog of the data science team. I was interested in understanding the way that Acorns customers were spending money on food. As a company we had a large collection of transaction level data coming in from Plaid but the data was not labeled in a way that was meaningful enough to understand what food spending looked like.  

Understanding Merchants 

Merchants are the companies that customers are spending with. This could be Starbucks, or the local Café and it could also be Whole Foods or the Gas Station. Some companies are notable and international like McDonalds so it’s easy to identify the business category. Other companies are small or only available in Middle America so it’s more challenging to understand what the company sells. 

Understanding a Transaction 

Millennials use many different forms of payment but the only form of payment meaningful to the company Acorns is a checking account because of the ability for checking account holders to have cash available to use for a purchase in the account and the ability to pay for a purchase in the market with merchants. Savings or ATM accounts will only enable you to collect available cash from a machine and credit card hold lines or credit which are not cash, neither of these accounts are useful in this case.  

Transactions coming from a debit card have an amount, a date of purchase, and a merchant name. Here is a very generic example: 

3/12/2022 Starbucks - $3.96 

A typical bank statement will have many transactions but the way that the bank decided to format the transaction in the monthly statement might be different. A monthly statement could have many transactions from different merchants for varying amounts. 

3/1/2022 Starbucks - $3.96 

3/1/2022 Macy’s - $44.21 

3/2/2022 Starbucks - $3.96 

3/2/2022 McDonalds - $9.46 

If we examine the sample cluster of transactions above, what do you notice? This is the way the project started for me. I had a list of transactions for a sample period, and they were all food related purchases, but I wanted to understand more.  

I thought about a few high-level themes: 

- Frequency 

- Budget 

- Tier 

- Sub-category 

#### Unpacking Frequency 

#### Examining a Budget 

#### Thinking about Tier 

#### Creating A Sub-Category for a Transaction
