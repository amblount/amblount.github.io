# A Resource List for Black Women in Professional Spaces (Academia)
I watched the film master and identified so many problems specific to being a black woman in professional spaces. As a young professional I dealt with many
of the issues on my own without terms and examples of how to deal with this. After two-years of intense talk therapy I was able to put words to many of my experiences and
understand how I could handle certain situations differently. I realize that so many women, especially black women, are unable to talk about the micro-aggressions that they face in
the workplace and there are no support groups that help you deal with them. Sometimes an individial therapy session is useful in helping you vocalize what the problem is for
you, but it doesn't point to a solution when what we need are solutions. 

That is why I created this project. It is just one Github Page but I think that it is a great start. I want you to understand that exploring any one of these resources might help
you realize that it is ok for you to feel your feelings and encourage you to step into the right direction.

In the words of the writer and director:
"Master is a horror film and it's set at Ancaster. It follows three women as they deal with racism and the supernatural in an incredibly isolating yet privileged space."

  - Not a very descriptive piece at all, but it you are looking for a VERY geneal overview of what happened and what a white female writer thinks of the film, this is a great start.

## How does this help me?
Hopefully after viewing all of this you are interested in watching the film. Please watch the film, it's available on Amazon Prime Video. It is a heavy film if you are black girl especially a black girl who has attended a PWI (primarily white institution), and I get it, it's hard to talk about some of the micro-aggressions that you experience on campus because some of them make you uncomfortable, but this is why I created this resource. I want you to be able to come to this page and scroll around to find something that might hit home with you. Some resource, like a blog post, or a theme that you might decide to unpack in therapy on your own. I want this to be a plce to start because this is something I didn't have when I was fresh into the workforce and I was trying to understand cross-cultural communication and adulting as a black female. It's hard out there, so don't go alone.

### Black YouTubers That Made My Year Great

Personally I am inspired by so many forms of content and so many different people, but black YouTubers have really made 2021 possible for me and some of the content really changed my perspective and gave me some validation that I needed in adulthood. There are some stories that have gone untold for too long and perspectives in mainstream, (read white) society that are not based on facts or reality.

I understand the impact and significance of music and musical artists but, a lot of times these artists are just make believe and they are singing songs about experiences that don‚Äôt pertain to their own lives.

I think young people are interested in role-models or other humans who have experienced something and found a way to deal with it. They want to learn from these experiences. I know for a fact that we need more representation, or a braoder set of representatives that give a range of blaack female experiences. So often black females are hypersexualized in mainstream media and it becomes difficult for people from other racial groups who do not come across normal black women to understand out perspectives or empathize with ouur points of view. This is why it has been so important for me to stay in touch with these communities who are speaking up and explore the ideas and experiences of other black women who are doing something besides just remaining oppressed. Too often so many of us are all consumed with with work and keeping up with capitalism that we don't have time to explore alternative points of view and learn new things.

#### Kidology
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HaCEUrVJfTc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Kidology creates long form content about modern issues in society from her personal frame of reference. She is an orphan who aws raised in a South African boarding school having transitioned through two white gaurdians and having to move to the UK to complete secondary school. This particular video unpacks tribalism but other videos talk about navigating social class issues and paying for University as a low income student. The talks about opportunity and a lack there of and what that means for her life chances and her dreams about her future and the way she looked at the world. There is no much intersectionality in her story and if I think about growing up with American Girl dolls, kidology could definitely have been a girl in the series with her own doll unpacking her very unique experience.

#### Fab Socialism
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yOck0QzHCzo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The Fab Socialism has changed the name of her channel a few times but her content pretty consistently unpacks the ways in which social media and popular culture inpact modern youth in society and what we should do about it. She creates content talking about upward mobility and the struggles of adulting as a modern day adult. She compares those who are apartment living to those who are houseless and breaks down some economic philosophies in terms of where we might go as an American society. I think her takes on the music industry and the social politics of players in the music industry is very relevant to the youth of the day given so many peoples focus on pop culture and the way it is changing the world we live in.

#### KAI Foster
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aq6YWy07_1Q" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

I found Kai a bit late in the year and I hate that. She was an undergraduate student at an HBCU, Howard when she started her channel. I had no idea how relatable her content would be. She had conversations with her female peers about men and her male peers about sports and academia. She has talked a lot about mental health and experimenting with drugs. Unfortunately as of today Kai has decided to stop creating content due to harrassment by another content creator but hopefully Kai leaves her content up, so that more women of color, especially black women are able to explore and unpack the content.

She is human 2.0, I love her ability to express her feelings

#### As TOLD by KENYA
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U-77wjcHWrA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Kenya was a 3rd year law student, but decided to drop out of law school after having a lot of success on YouTube and purchasing a home. Her content is so relatable. She is like the voice of reason in the black community having a very close thumb on black twitter at any given point in time and is able to share why some mainstream event or statement from some god awful celebrity is just that, trash.
It‚Äôs refreshing. Join her patreon community. Kneya is also a booktuber and a lot of her more recent content is full of book reviews. There are not many black book tubers so Kenya is an ni you might want to hop on.

#### CAMRYN Elise
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x5aySAM7R4k" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

My girl Cam, she is just a wonderful explainer of the tik tok mess and cultural appropriation. It is clear she has been the one black person in a white space for a while, just like me,
It‚Äôs exhausting

She has her hand on the culture and we all need to hear it. If I has a big sis like Cam, I could take over the world. Seriously. Black girls come through.

#### Most of MIREE
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bRlui9C-KuE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

MIREE gave me hope for gen Z, when I found her channel I knew, this next generation of girls and just built different. We are no longer in this perpetual state of black girl poverty and injustice and bullshit that the television loves to promote, we have evolved into something else.
We are clearly what we have been waiting for, as in no one else is coming
Miree is the girl next door that has experiences in her neighborhood and in her community. Black experiences, high school experiences, family relationships‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääreally all the normal average parts of life. In her case her mother is a therapist and has taken a lot of care in the way that she raised her child and thus how Miree shows up in the world. You should watch her content, you won‚Äôt be disappointed.

#### KHADIJA Mbowe
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EtfE-BsB5v0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Let‚Äôs talk about video essays
All of things that you probably brush over in conversations with other people, Khadija actually breaks down in her video essays. It is clear she actually prepares the content she would like to talk about by reading articles on the subject matter and listening to other YouTubers or academic lectures on the topic. She uses all of that data to create or validate her own opinion on a lot of hot topics that are of importance in the black community and pop-culture.

#### Kianna Naomi
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jDkibxbVw5o" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Kianna started making clothing haul videos and pulled her number of subscribers into the millions. She was young back then and trying to find her voice. Now that she has grown into a young adult Kianna is creating content about exploring her personal style and traveling around the world having most recently moved to Colombia. Some of her videos that have inspired me include the videos where she talks about creating a routine to stay in shape and how she learned to love her 4C hair, but it was a journey for her to get there. Her personality is light and fun, I think that if you need an emotional pick me up, Kianna might be your girl.

#### Kelly Stamps
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gpUhkASzIgU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Kelly Stamps owned the internet in 2021. She turned herself into an internet meme and was able to bring ont camera a new black female character we hadn't seen before - Kelly, She is extremely sarcastic and a bit whitty, but always honest. She is effortlessly humorous and extremely cute. She has incredible style and has taken minimalism to another level. We all live for the lessons we learn from professor stamps and are all enrolled in the Stampeded University. Long live Kelly!

#### Vanessa kanbi
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HxsEX2CJu2s" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Vanessa Kanbi has moved her family from the UK to Ghana West Africa and she wants everyone to know how great it is. I think that she had many questions about what it was like to live in Africa before she moved there and once she did she wanted to be a resource for anyone else who had questions. She makes videos where explores different homes in Ghana and informs viewers about the price of the home and gives you a good idea of what the ammenities are of the unit and the surrounding envirnment.

#### Joulzey
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PRhhUlSTtbA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Joulzey might be on of he first black content creators to share what the middle class black experience is really like. She talks a lot about her college experiences and the interestinf characters of other races who participated in those experiences with her. She breaks down some experiences she had with men and what she would do differently today. She is extremely relatable. She is currently enrolled in a master program in sociology I believe and hosts a book club that you can join to reac some of the content she is reading in class. She also regularly interviews the authors of the books she is reading so you will get an opportunity to ask the authors your burning questions. She has broken down Bell Hooks books and the like. Joulzey might the channel you want to explore if you are that girl who ilkes to get her read on.

Seren is a YouTuber that I found during a the intense portion of civil unrest even before the George Floyd protests. I can't remember which black person was gunned down, but I do remember coming across one of Serens older videos where she spoke about how she couldn't remain silent anymore. I think this was during the time of the Ferguson outrage. She bought a train ticket and filmed herself protesting with other activits and share her tumbler page where she detailed action steps that the activitst groups were taking to support Black Lives in real time. Seren gave a very honest point of view about what it feels like to be a black female living in America with the deep understanidng of the hostory of racism in this country. She has entire playlists that describe what it feels like to be a Black American right now and how we should use black economics to at least try and help the black community. Every Sunday for about 3 years Seren hosted something called Beezebake where many of us would get together and watch a film that cast mostly black actors and told stories about the Black American experience. I appreciate Serene and her channel so much because her voice was loud and proud and available when so many others were quiet and we needed to talk about it, we still need to talk about a lot of things.
