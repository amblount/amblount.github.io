# A Resource List for Black Women in Professional Spaces (Academia)
I watched the film master and identified so many problems specific to being a black woman in professional spaces. As a young professional I dealt with many
of the issues on my own without terms and examples of how to deal with this. After two-years of intense talk therapy I was able to put words to many of my experiences and
understand how I could handle certain situations differently. I realize that so many women, especially black women, are unable to talk about the micro-aggressions that they face in
the workplace and there are no support groups that help you deal with them. Sometimes an individial therapy session is useful in helping you vocalize what the problem is for
you, but it doesn't point to a solution when what we need are solutions. 

That is why I created this project. It is just one Github Page but I think that it is a great start. I want you to understand that exploring any one of these resources might help
you realize that it is ok for you to feel your feelings and encourage you to step into the right direction.

In the words of the writer and director:
"Master is a horror film and it's set at Ancaster. It follows three women as they deal with racism and the supernatural in an incredibly isolating yet privileged space."

Her name is Mariama Diallo, and she has explained why she wrote it.

  - Not a very descriptive piece at all, but it you are looking for a VERY geneal overview of what happened and what a white female writer thinks of the film, this is a great start.

## How does this help me?
Hopefully after viewing all of this you are interested in watching the film. Please watch the film, it's available on Amazon Prime Video. It is a heavy film if you are black girl especially a black girl who has attended a PWI (primarily white institution), and I get it, it's hard to talk about some of the micro-aggressions that you experience on campus because some of them make you uncomfortable, but this is why I created this resource. I want you to be able to come to this page and scroll around to find something that might hit home with you. Some resource, like a blog post, or a theme that you might decide to unpack in therapy on your own. I want this to be a plce to start because this is something I didn't have when I was fresh into the workforce and I was trying to understand cross-cultural communication and adulting as a black female. It's hard out there, so don't go alone.
