# A Resource List for Black Women in Professional Spaces (Academia)
I watched the film master and identified so many problems specific to being a black woman in professional spaces. As a young professional I dealt with many
of the issues on my own without terms and examples of how to deal with this. After two-years of intense talk therapy I was able to put words to many of my experiences and
understand how I could handle certain situations differently. I realize that so many women, especially black women, are unable to talk about the micro-aggressions that they face in
the workplace and there are no support groups that help you deal with them. Sometimes an individial therapy session is useful in helping you vocalize what the problem is for
you, but it doesn't point to a solution when what we need are solutions. 

That is why I created this project. It is just one Github Page but I think that it is a great start. I want you to understand that exploring any one of these resources might help
you realize that it is ok for you to feel your feelings and encourage you to step into the right direction.

  - Not a very descriptive piece at all, but it you are looking for a VERY geneal overview of what happened and what a white female writer thinks of the film, this is a great start.
