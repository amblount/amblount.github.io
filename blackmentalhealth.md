As a Black American female first-generation descendant of American chattel Slavery (D.A.C.S.) research scientist living in Oakland, CA under the Trump presidency, life is not simple for me to say the least, and I struggle with my mental health at times. I have been meaning to draft this post for a while but I was afraid to talk about an issue that is so stigmatized in the black community and the general community at large. If it is not apparent society is NOT ok, we are NOT doing our best currently and it might be something that you need to talk about and that is ok. You will be ok. I am ok.

I could say a lot more but I think that there are so many people who have perspectives on this topic who have inspired me and I would like to share this post as a resource to anyone who might feel othered or alone and needs some sort of community or a need to hear others talk about mental health.

Looker hosted a panel on black mental health and it gave me life.


Docs with Disabilities featured Dr. Justin Bullock a UCSF Internal Resident who shared his experience with hospitalizations, suicide, and depression.

I appreciated hearing Rob's experience supporting Lauren through a hospitalization, it was interesting to hear the point of the view of a friend supporting someone dealing with an extreme mental health situation.


If you are unfamiliar with Dr. Leigh Sundam and the fact that she committed suicide after not being matched to a medical residency due to her past drug addiction, you can donate to her scholarship and read her story on her go fund me page.

There are so many resources but if you need to talk, I highly encourage you to find a psychologist or therapist and talk out your stuff, it really does help.

To this day I am not sure what happened to Nora, but I do know how isolating it is to be the only black woman in white spaces like #stanford so #RIP
