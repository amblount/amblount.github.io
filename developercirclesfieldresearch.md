The Field Research Study

One of the program managers in EMEA mentioned there was a great female lead in Tunis, Tunisia who lead a very engaged circle and that if we had the capacity we should support one of her events. I saw this as an opportunity to test my assumptions and created a plan on how I would do this. A few months earlier I attended the field study masterclass by Jan Chipchase and used his textbook the Field Study Handbook to conduct the study.

Here is what I did:

Made a warm introduction to the developer circle lead, mentioning that it would be awesome to support her upcoming event.
Asked her what type of content would be presented during the event and how I could help support her.
Based on her content, I created a pre-event content guide filled with online resources explaining the topic more in depth and how to apply technical frameworks to solve the problem.
I also planned to host a pre-event workshop detailing what data science looks like on my team at Facebook and what resources I used to get into data science online.
Asked for recommendations of group member who I could reach out to to understand the development ecosystem in the area more in depth and interview these members.
Created a survey for the selected developers to describe their interest in the developer circle community and specifically what the community could use to become a more active and engaged community.
Discussed the survey results with my team of program managers to get some initial feedback.

The refined user research design process

I did not always have such an in depth research process and I think that it is important to note the way that I became such an in depth product researcher.

Back in 2016, I started my web development boot-camp experience. I didn't have much coding experience and so in a lot of the group projects I worked on initially, I was the front-end web designer. I spent a lot of time building front-end web apps using Google's Material design and a Firebase backend. The documentation for both of these frameworks is really easy to get started with so I got to know a lot about making a website look pretty. The more and more I built web applications the more I started to think about the amount of time that I was spending rebuilding for the user experience. At the time I was unfamiliar with what a user-experience designer actually was, but I did know that if I spent more time initially speaking with the end users of my product I would be able to build a better product. This sent me down an entire rabbit hole and caused me to change the way that I would build projects.

Before integrating user experience design + research:

Building a product looked something like this:

Ideate with other software engineers about what it is we would like to build
Search through documentation online to understand what data we have available which we could use for the project
Create a few general wireframes, which would pictorially represent a login page, a sign-up page and one page which displayed the core functionality of the app
After integrating user experience design + research:

Building product looks more like this:

Find a question out in the world which has yet to be answered in a way suitable for me or someone else
Explore ways in which other people have tried to solve the problem before
If someone has successfully designed something useful before, think through how I could improve that product, and what would make my solution better and explicitly how.
If I can not find anyone who has built a similar solution, explore why others did not find the space worthy enough to build in and weigh the costs and benefits to spending time and resources building in said space
3. Chat with as many product owners or end users as possible to understand how and why they would this product

Get these people to draw pictures of solutions they imagine
Ask them for recommendations to other similar products with some component which they find outstanding, and figure out why
4. Build a prototype of the product

5. Determine if any team (in a large org) is willing to allocate financial resources to the project, validating its build

6. Explore the engineering resources available for maintenance of the product

If there is only one engineer available to build a product and the team is trying to scale a Weebly, or WIX solution would be more valuable
If there are 2-10 engineers allocated to the project and there are more than 100,000 anticipated end users, you can think more about scale and speed for architectural design solutions
7. Create a technology stack design implementation over sprints

Based on the answers to the questions above you can determine things like:
cloud versus local storage, and how much
database schema design
API integrations
User account management
security and data privacy
analytics integration
8. Create a project plan

As you create a project roadmap, you understand in the amount of time you have dedicated to a particular project how much can you reasonably get done
Figure out what are the most important features to implement right away to get a minimum viable product
Figure out how to place additional features into production accordingly in sprints
Match the resources to a budget, if you have a roadmap with 12 months of development work required but only enough money for 3 months of development time, you need to explore which features from the development roadmap are the most important and place all of them in the first sprint and make sure that the developers are only working on building those particular features, nothing more and definitely nothing less
9. Start building!

Identify the problem and build the solution

After the trip, I learned that developers in the developing countries are trying to bridge the gap between traditional education (university) and skills which would make them ready for work. They have a broad range of interests but do not currently have the skills to contribute to the workforce at the moment. I realize then that we needed a product which would help these students and graduates bridge this gap. In development, we already had a partnership with Kaplan to provide web development training in an online format, but the team had not fully examined what would be the most useful curriculum to distribute. As a person who graduated from dev bootcamp, the physical bootcamp which distributed the Kaplan content, I was able to give a lot of insight into how and why this curriculum would be relevant or not. I also had a broad range of knowledge about what other topics students in the field cared about.

I created a project plan which detailed the topic areas which I determined students cared about and would need practical skills to move forward. I then prioritized the three tracks which we could build the curriculum for by sourcing the web and writing guides for.

Check out one of the groups:

You can browse around the site. The guides that you see, I write the text for, the links were sourced by me, and the learning path was developed by me, the sequence of steps.

I managed a team of engineers which we hired as external vendors, there were 5 engineers, one user experience designer, and a database administrator. We had daily 30 minute stand up sessions where we discussed the progress of the project. They had an external JIRA board which I monitored and we created a project road map dividing the project into sprints over 12 months. The first sprint ended with the launch of the product at F8, and we decided to postpone the production of the product until we understand how the users were using the product so that we would understand where exactly we should invest more money.

This project had a budget of $1.5 million dollars to serve a community of around ~150,000 developers. This product was intended to serve as an introductory tool to help developers go from University graduates with no practical work experience to entry-level developers with a few projects under their belts. There are many online resources for learning how to code, but some have a very high price tag per/ head so we did not have the budget to finance each person and other programs did not contain the practical personalized learning experience which has been proven to promote understanding and help the new learning process and digest new information. This was an important differentiating factor when thinking about how we would structure the program because we did not want to provide students with surface-level "Simon Says" projects because the learners would not be able to transfer the understanding to an employer and the value would be lost. We wanted to make sure to include multiple perspectives from a variety of content creators so that consumers with different learning styles would be able to consume the ideas being presented. This was really important in making sure that the funds we did have for this project were being managed well and would provide utility to our community.
