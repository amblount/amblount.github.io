# The Field Research Study

While working with the developer relations program at Facebook, one of my data science initiatves involved understanding and improving meaningful engagement in online groups. I have [written about meaningful engagement](), so if you are curious about what it is please read that post. Facebook groups bring together members with similar interests, but for developers they are online spaces where engineers share technical resources. As a former software engineer living in the Bay Area, California (tech-hub), there were many in-person events that I could attend where I could meet and engage with other technical folks and trouble shoot the bugs in my code. I was unaware, at the time, of how developers in the developing world would troubleshoot so I spent alot of time reading posts from active groups (groups who were posting often) to understand the subject area of the posts.

There were 119 developer circle groups from all over the world who held in person events under the leadership of volunteer group members, whom we called Dev-C leads. The Dev-C leads would communicate directly with a regional program manager about the specs of the events (date, time, # devs expected), and the program manager could talk generally about the happenings in the region they were in charge of. The EMEA program manager. mentioned over breakfast that there was a very active female-lead group in North Africa that we should support in person. Our team at the time was very small and everyone had a lot on their plate so creating the time to go to the in-person event in North Africa was a huge commitment. 

I started to pay close attention to the online group in Tunis, Tunisa (North Africa) that the program manager mentioned and got to know the Dev-C lead over messenger chat. She informed me that they were having a deep learning hackathon and asked if I could support. I was so excited by the offer and I immediately spoke to my manager about it. My manager said that if I created a project plan and demonstrated in the plan how I could use the trip to improve the meaningful engagement model, that I could go.

This is the story of how I created the project plan, the tools I used to create one and how I improved meaningful engagement in one online group.

#### Jan Chipchase and The Field Study Masterclass
 <img src="/images/userresearchstudy.jpg" width="175" />
 
What was the class?

Jan Chipchase is an international user experience researcher who is well-known for going into the developing world and helping large organizations establis a presence there by understanding the local customs and traditional norms and explaining that to the development team of the large company. A great example of this is McDonalds building it's first location in India. There are certain parts of India where it is disrespectful to eat meat and so McDonalds had to think about how to change the menu to fit the new customer segment. 

What did I learn?

I learned how to listen and build trust with people living in the developing world given the high potential for fraud. Online spaces have made it a bit easier to understand what is going on and where and more news segments like Vice, and Vox are covering the political happenings in parts of the developing world, but if you are planning a trip you need to make sure that you are safe. I learned how to use the internet to find a credible palce, this could be a hotel and ask the hotel management for help finding a guide. A guide is a local in that community who lives there and speaks your language. This guide needs to understand your goals and what it is you would like to see so they can plan accordingly and understand what to show you. It is important for you to pay this guide, obviously, but it might even make some sense to pay using a task management system, so you can say once you coplete this tak I will give you this much money and then continue to follow through.

How did I apply what I learned in my project plan?

Initialy I used the Dev-C lead as my guide and I was able to get a lot of resources from her, this is until I found a better guide. I found Yahya, and learned all about the developer ecosystem from him. I even interviewed him and was able to travel to some remote places that I would not have been able to otherwise. 
 

#### Cultural Context and Finding a Guide

I used the online group to connect with the Dev-C lead who lived and worked as a software engineer in Tunis, Tunisia. Once I made a decision to actually travel to Tunisa, there were so many parts of the trip that I needed to plan. I needed to:

- book a flight to Africa
- get a new passport
- book a hotel in Tunis, near the site of the event
- book a car to and from the hotel
- figure out how to manaeuver customs and global entry
- approve the trip using the internal management software (concur, internal business travel tool)
- plan for my data science talk
- gather the prizes for the hackathon (2 oculus rifts)

I can write a bit more about the international travel and all of the internal project planning that went into making this happen but the most important bit of information here concerns the hotel, which was recommended by the Dev-C lead. 

I would also like to make a note here around electricity, baggage and customs.

> International adapters are needed to plug in products made for and in America. The wall outlets in other countries are different and you may blow a fuse if you try to just plug in your product or device into the wall. I would suggest going to Best Buy or ordering an international wall outlet online. Here is an image of the outlet that I used.

> Packing for an international business trip can be overwhelming the first time, but pro-tip, just pack one bag and ensure that you have maybe two main outfits and undergarmets. Maybe one dress. Wear something comfortable to and from the airport and shoes that are going to work for the weather where you are traveling.

> Your things might get lost if you check your bag but if you need technology like a computer or something else ensure you get it in the USA or UK because it WILL NOT be available once you land in the developing world.

> Before you leave the airport where you land use the ATM to pull out cash, you don't know where you are goint to come across another ATM and it could be dangerous to pull out cash on the street. Finding a bank isn't the easiest task and if you don't have your SIM card situation figured out with cellular service, this could be a problem. Having cash in the local currency allows you to call a cab and give them the name of the airport or just grab food if need be.

Once I landed in North Africa, Tunis, and checked into my hotel I tok a stroll around the neighborhood. Because my orginal guide seleced the hotel and it was 5 stars I knew it was an okay neighborhood. Walking around I found signs for a developer community and I walked in, this is where I found another guide and he took [me all around Tunisia](https://youtube.com/shorts/Sc_IZuEK9rk?feature=share).

#### Survey
Created a survey for the selected developers to describe their interest in the developer circle community and specifically what the community could use to become a more active and engaged community.

#### The pre-event Guide (CMS)

#### The project plan
As you create a project roadmap, you understand in the amount of time you have dedicated to a particular project how much can you reasonably get done
Figure out what are the most important features to implement right away to get a minimum viable product
Figure out how to place additional features into production accordingly in sprints
Match the resources to a budget, if you have a roadmap with 12 months of development work required but only enough money for 3 months of development time, you need to explore which features from the development roadmap are the most important and place all of them in the first sprint and make sure that the developers are only working on building those particular features, nothing more and definitely nothing less

#### 5 Steps to deigning your own user research study

1. Find a question out in the world which has yet to be answered in a way suitable for me or someone else
2. Explore ways in which other people have tried to solve the problem before. 
   - If someone has successfully designed something similar in the past, think through how it could be improved
   - If you are unable to find an existing similar solution, explore why others did not find the space worthy enough to build in and weigh the costs and benefits to spending time and resources building in said space
3. Chat with as many product owners or end users as possible to get feedback and talk about your understanding of the space
   - Get these people to share or create images or websites/ groups
   - Ask them for recommendations 
4. Create a project plan
5. Talk openly about your project and share the project details document with appropriate parties.
   - The more openly you talk about the project you will find other people who have an interest in the outcome of the project and may be able to allocate financial resources to the project
