When individuals face hardship they can usually find comfort in working through their problem with a group of people they feel comfortable with. You might refer to this group as a tribe. There are many types of tribes some based on geographic location others based on race and others based on a combination of race, gender, age, class, and geolocation. In terms of technology and the current workforce in silicon valley you might consider a tribe a group of software engineers working in finance, or maybe a group of user experience designers working across product teams at Amazon or Facebook. Whatever the parameters being used to define the tribe, it is important to understand the othering. The othering is the very clear line in the sand which dictates that in the tribe there is 'us' and outside of the tribe are 'them'. The tribe usually creates values and customs to benefit their group and vote or act in strategic ways other every else, usually towards the detriment of everyone else.


America has been known as a melting pot and a great social experiment in relation to the diversity of race, class, religion and political views among a range of other things. Our democracy enables and protects certain human rights defined in the bill of rights, particularly free speech and freedom of religion. In terms of the countries economic system of free market capitalism this should create the opportunity for everyone across tribes to have access to upward mobility, this is the idea that if you work hard you can be whatever you want to be.


It turns out the rise of tribalism and the inability of individual tribes to have any sort of collective human interest policy has created a winner take all way of moving through society and neglects the needs of the global homo sapiens species which could be considered a tribe all its own. America is in a great position to start to have dialogue across tribal groups and enable these groups to understand the challenges being faced by each group and hopefully start to develop solutions which address the individual tribes problem and propagates the solution to other tribal groups globally. I strongly believe that globally due to the increasing political climate and growing wealth inequality, simple thinking about migration and assimilation in developed region is not enough. I believe that we need to start to have conversations about the problems that migrants are fleeing from and work to solve those problems. As humans we are at a point where we have to confront climate change head on as ONE tribal group and figure out ways in which we can cohabitate. I think that this is the most important conversation that we need to have as a species and we have so many civil disputes and conflicts that need a resolution. I don't think that it is equitable to continue to keep the conversation closed to only include academics or extremely wealthy people.


If history has taught us anything, it might be that those with power and money did not always acquire those goods in the most ethical way. This means that the process which lead to the wealth creation included variables which harmed other groups of people. I understand that people who suffer from the harm might need to flee for self preservation, but I think these same people who are familiar with the variables which have contributed to the wealth creation, need to speak out on the injustice and help society document and understand the causes of injustice. This is really important for me, as an ML researcher because I don't want to misunderstand the variables going into my models and cause more groups of people to be at a disadvantage. For all of people who have successfully migrated to America and escaped the political turmoil elsewhere, there are others who were left behind. It is unethical to believe that some people are more worthy than others to the right to life. As we enter the conversation concerning forced climate migration, it is important to think about who is able to enter and why and define those parameters clearly because there is no way that every human is going to be able to migrate to areas which have been able to prepare for climate disasters.

I also think that it is important to understand the political power that groups of individuals with money have to make decisions about where to live on the planet and why. Many smart people migrate to the Bay Area because they care about climate change and understand that geographically in terms climate disaster risk factors, earthquakes are the most likely occurrence and there is a greater likelihood of surviving an earthquake than a tsunami. Not to be biased but those most intellectual among us have also figured out that if an when an earthquake does occur it would make sense to not be around too many bridges, water sources or tall buildings, and this is why those of us living in east bay care deeply about policies which regulate the development of skyscrapers.

Whats next? or Where?
Obviously Africa and Africa + China relations


Well it seems that the Western world with virtually NO natural resources have created a system of exploitation and profited generously from this exploitation. I wonder how we could build a machine learning model and define parameters to create a more equitable and fair distribution of wealth to those with the actual natural resources. From my perspective this would require us to define:

who?
what?
when?
where?
how?
And make sure to start to right these wrongs. It is not secret that Europe for a long period of time has been exploiting African for resources and it seems France still be collecting a tax from Haiti due to the Haitian revolution. I wonder if there would be another great depression in France if the Parisians there were not collecting money from Haiti for wanting to be free? This might drastically change who gets what and why and what [stories] are being shared about history.

How do we resolve these longstanding conflicts?
I think that we start by having difficult conversations like this one:

I think that Dinesh poses a great question: 'Do we give back the land which was stolen from each successive group?'

I think that former President Obama has a much more fluid way of describing these ideas and how we can think about taking action in terms of making change.
