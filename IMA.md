# Hey itâ€™s alivia send me your spinning up account 
https://www.universalmusic.com/label/spinnup/

Spinning up is a platform for independent artists run by Universal Music Group (UMG). I dont work with them I am just familiar with the platform and pay attention to new artists. If you are an artist or know any artists create an account. UMG is one of the major record labels and I know that new or aspiring artists have a lot of questions about how to get started and where to share their music or how to create a music page. I have tried to do my best to aggregate a few resources here because in the beginning for me everything was so confusing and it has taken me year to figure things out.

I spent some time as an entrepreneur in residence with Capital Music Group and Universal Music Group and was able to talk to people working in A&R to understand a bit more about the business side of music.

A former entertainment lawyer and a social commentary youtuber got together and broke down some really important information about the music business, you might want to check that out.

Pharrel also gave a great talk a few years ago about the music industry and ownership, this seems useful for new artists to know.

2. Snatch  free beat from YouTube (google free beat, insert genre)
3. Record your vocal audio and beat in garage band with some sort of mic situation
4. Submit your music to [United Masters](https://unitedmasters.com/)
5. Contact customer support to ensure you have ownership rights to your page on apple music and spotify music
6. Submit your art to [Tiny Desk Competitions](https://www.npr.org/series/1072544367/tiny-desk-contest) and [Festivals](https://www.findfestival.com/)

I am more interested in data journalism and sentiment analysis now, so I am writing about how music makes you feel.

## I started gaining skills in technology due to the high cost of living
<img width="500" height="500" alt="Screen Shot 2021-08-15 at 2 35 47 PM" src="/images/visualNoteImg.jpg">

  - I completed a web development bootcamp
  - I completed another software engineering bootcamp
  - I did a few internships
  - I did a few corporate jobs
  - I was burnt out and started writing about food and leisure
  - I started making videos about adulting and living on my own

Having skills in technology is just useful becauwe you can work and create. I learned early on that there was too much I didn't understand about art as an industry and I would need to keeo a job during the time that I was trying to build a creative empire. You can do this do with Google Online Certificates. They offer financial aid options and you are able to learn skills like project management and data analytics all from the comfort of your own home after work. With about a year of investment in time you could learn a new skill that should be able to pay for your cost of living in any major city so that you can spend your off time working on creative projects that bring you joy.

### I am for sure just an arts school girl at heart


- Elementary School: Berkeley Arts Magnet (Dance)
- Middle School: Longfellow Arts and Technology (Dance)
- Primary School 1: Oakland School For the Arts (Dance - transfer)
- Primary School 2: Berkeley High School Graduate (Diploma)
- Community College: Berkeley City College - Associates Degree (General Ed)
- Uni: University of California, Davis - Bs (Computer Science. incomplete)

I could spend more time and go back to school, but I really enjoy living on my own in my own apartment. I pay marketplace rent and that requires a job.

I like to mention my primary and secondary school experiences because I spent so many of my years in arts school. It was a bit more than a hobby for me. At the time there weren't many people who were able to turn a passion for hip-hop dance into an actual career that would sustain a meaningful quality of life. This is why I made the choice to study something technical in case I needed to get a real job. I do enjoy writing about my prior experiences in dance and in technology and telling those stories online.

#### Short excerpt from a digital scrapbook

It's something that I like to do when I am bored because I can think back to special moments in my life. Growing up I had a lot of extra-curricular activities, and I was able to meet so many cool people and travel around the bay area. The Bay Area is a really diverse place to live and so meeting new people from other neighborhoods and cities means that you will probably come across another culture from another part of the world. This scrapbook is a collection of some of my favorite moments and details how I got into certain activities and what those activites meant to me. Unfortunately growing up although I participated in performance arts I don't have many videos of the event, but I can still tell the story of what happened.

This is a digital scrapbook that I am creating for you to get a sense of the ways that utilized my times outside of academics throughout primary and secondary school. I met a LOT of great friends and was able to travel all around the country. When I was in high school all of the students were clustered by social groups and where you hung out on campus determined what your typical social interests were. I was very interested in music and fashion so I hung out at the bricks for about 15 minutes each day after my final period before I attended my first after school program or the library. I transferred from Oakland School for the Arts, where I studies dance to Berkeley high and I was behind academically. I had to spend a lot of time in the library after school to get tutoring for my schoolwork and use the computers to do my homework. When I think back I was on the right track, but I lacked appropriate study skills so I was unable to think through how the concepts that I was studying applied to my real life and how to apply that information to my classroom experience. One really great take away from my senior year, which was the year I took this picture, I had a really great physical exercise routine. I had one physical injury in arts school where I hurt my knee and I was afraid that if I injured my knee any further I wouldn't be able to dance any more EVER. Instead of continuing ballet training, I enrolled in hot yoga or Bikram. It's a really great style of yoga that stretches muscles you don't normally use and makes you sweat.

### I won a few hackathons and was able to work with Universal Music Group 3x

### How did Begin to care?
I grew up around musicians and it was difficult for me to understand how artists make money given so many artists end up broke. I knew that certain people were making money in the business but honestly I didn't understand how much of the business of music works. I did a lot of independent research speaking with different teams inside of Universal Music Group to understand royalties, and masters and try to get a feel of who owns music specifically in a streaming era.

### My Family
Some members on my mom's side of the my family are the descendants of American Chattel Slavery (D.A.C.S.) and many of them lived off of the wealth created by my uncles music career. It retrospect this should not have been such an integral part of my story growing up but so few people in my family had access to higher education or quality publid education through secondary schooling that their life chances were non-existent outside of fields in entertainment. My uncle (Little Walter) was a problematic, outspoken drunk whose overconsumption eventually lead to his death as depicted in the film, Cadillac Records. As momumental as it was for me to see the story of a beloved family member on screen, it just reminded me of the purpose and significance of ownership in music for artists. Althought listening to good musis is a wonderful experience for so many consumers, people fail to realize that many artists feed and raise their families with the money they ear in this career. Personally for me the second home that I grew up in was paid for money that my uncle earned playing the harmonica. The story is an integral part of my life.

### The Blues Museum, St. Louis
On a previous team, I traveled to St. Louis to support developers working in one of the North American tech hubs and while walking around the community I passed the national museum of blues and purchased a ticket to enter. I was suprised to find so many artifacts containing imargery and documents of my uncle, and it was an incredible experience for me. When I told my grandmother about it, she cried for a few weeks becuase she had so many memories about her brother and what he meant to her as a person but I think more importantly socially and for the trajectory of her life and her family. For her it wasn't jusy music it was a home or place of refuge after my family had to run away from gang violence in Chicago. Little Walter's songs in her case were like biblical chants of freedom and prosperity and obserd as that may sound.
