'We don't need to try ideas we know are not going to work.' - [Lecun](https://ieeetv.ieee.org/conference-highlights/self-supervised-learning-world-models-icra-2020?)

If we think about this in terms of metalearning or as a larger system of data collection, there must be some way to think about how
we can design algorithms which collect information about portions of the system which did not work and use that data where it could be useful,
there may be some other system in which that idea does work, so context is really important here. How can we ensure that we are inclusing context in the data collection process.
