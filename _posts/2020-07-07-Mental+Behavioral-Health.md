  - primary care side - how do we become part of the workflow so that it is top of mind (mental health), default referral and making the process easy
  - mental health provider side - disaggregated place, providers feel isolated, need to work together with primary care physicians- small business
  - no show for mental health services is really high - 30% [HIGH]
  - creating an environment where care being provided is a part of whole body well being, leveraging existing services
- Fragmented? They don't interact with primary care physicians (mental health providers)
  - skepticism around the effectiveness of care
  - Going from 30% --> 15% no show is a really great improvement
- Great user experience means being in the workflow of primary care physicians - helping users do what they need to do
- How to support medicaid patients?
  - socio-demographic issues
  - highest percentage of people insured with mental health conditions
  - challenges of provider networks 
  - Integration with EHR's
- Improve outcomes - what has happened in the past
- Leadership requires a good team, how have you lead a team

- For medicaid patients what does it look like to be under the care of a primary care physician?
- What are the current methods of communication between patients and their primary care physician?
- What symptoms are typically present during physical health visits that would indicate the presence of a mood disorder or a mental health condition?
- How do you encourage people to participate in therapy, how can you explain its benefit?
- How do you pull data out of an EHR? Do the medical providers enable API access? Is this data clean?
