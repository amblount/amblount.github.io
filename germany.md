# I'm moving to Germany

yeah, yeah so I know I've said this before but I need a place to store all of the info I've found on the web and try to make 
some sense out of it all, this isn't just a sporadic move, its for real.

1. Find a job
2. Get a work visa
3. Find an apartment
4. Buy a place ticket
5. Make a budget

Rinse and repeat kinda...
