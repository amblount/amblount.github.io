It is often noted that history is just the falsifying of records by those in power, otherwise known as [his]-story. During my first college english course one of the required text books, was entitled, "Lies my teacher told me." It seems American history has been so watered down and white-washed throughout primary and secondary school, once you make it college they feel like you have paid enough in time and money to learn the truth!


Oppressed groups all over the world have as many experiences if not more than those we read about in any sort of text, but how many impoverished people do you know working 60-hours per week for minimum wage who have time to blog? This has become such an interesting phenomenon affecting so many Americans that sociologists have taken note and even conducted field research studies where they have gone undercover to experience this type of poverty firsthand.

All the while there has been one small group of storytellers who have managed to keep accurate records of their personal experiences of pain and triumph and with sequence models, we can now analyze music videos and audio tracks. With services like the ROVI API - which powers the metadata for all of the streaming services like Pandora and Spotify, we can even understand the sentiment of the song. There are entire research groups working on music information retrieval algorithms which can help us understand the meaning behind the music algorithmically.

There are so many ways we can think about improving human relationships in terms of music recommendation engines.


Let's take a brief look back in time and explore just how we can use music videos to explain the human experience from groups who may not have written documentation explaining their lived experience but nonetheless have audio which if analyzed appropriately could produce new streams of metadata. This metadata could serve as features in models created to identify meaning in emotional states and therefor help add new genres used for music classification and therefor improve music recommendation algorithms and help with artist discovery. This could be life-changing for certain groups of people who are not able to identify personally with the humans in their environment due to the rise of tribalism, classism, racism, and the imposition of religious philosophy on those who are unwilling.

Before we start this analysis I think it is important to include the feeling wheel for those who may not be familiar. We will pull from this as we work through examples.

This is the start of an independent research project, look out for an upcoming dataset where I create metadata affiliated with each of these songs, it will include artist profile demographics and target audience demographics.
