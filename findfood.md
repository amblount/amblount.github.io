# Project Find Food Bay Area

## What is it?

Short answer:
We identify food products in-store through a database and feed the hungry.

Long Answer:
Whole Foods Market is a high quality grocery store in upper middle class neighborhoods and unfortunately there are many people living in the neighborhoods where Whole Foods is located who are food insecure and this is sad. I thought about what I could do about this and how I could make a difference given how much time I have personally spent researching Food Access in New York and what I understand about the pantry system. As a sub-company under Amazon - Amazon Prime members are able to order groceries online and have them delivered to their homes. This is a really convenient way to grocery shop and has thus created a new market or in store shoppers. These in store shoppers receieve a list of items from a customer and are tasked with walking around the store to pick up the items off of the shelf and ring them up at the counter. These employees are called in store shoppers. The description of an in store shopper sounds simple but the job is acually a bit more complicated than it seems initially given how many items are in the store and how difficult it can be to find an item there needs to be more tools in place to help the amazon shoppers find items.
