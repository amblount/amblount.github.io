# Project Find Food Bay Area

## What is it?

Short answer:
We identify food products in-store through a database and feed the hungry.

Long Answer:
Whole Foods Market is a high-quality grocery store in upper-middle-class neighborhoods and unfortunately, there are many people living in the neighborhoods where Whole Foods is located who are food insecure and this is sad. I thought about what I could do about this and how I could make a difference given how much time I have personally spent researching Food Access in New York and what I understand about the pantry system. As a sub-company under Amazon - Amazon Prime members are able to order groceries online and have them delivered to their homes. This is a really convenient way to grocery shop and has thus created a new market for in-store shoppers. These in-store shoppers receive a list of items from a customer and are tasked with walking around the store to pick up the items off of the shelf and ring them up at the counter. These employees are called in-store shoppers. The description of an in-store shopper sounds simple but the job is actually a bit more complicated than it seems initially given how many items are in the store and how difficult it can be to find an item there needs to be more tools in place to help the amazon shoppers find items. 

Our product and service employ low-income community members to go into the store and itemize items in-store and add them to our database to update our mobile application and help the in-store shoppers find items they are looking for. We connect our database to the online product inventory of the whole foods mobile application and add additional meta-data like the aisle, shelf, and compartment on the shelf. Once we get enough data into the application we would like to use machine learning to make recommendations to the shoppers like which items they should pick up first to make the fastest run through the store.
